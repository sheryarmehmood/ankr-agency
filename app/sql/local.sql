I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today a couple of guests, Ryan Welcher and Mario Santos, who have joined me to talk about the Interactivity API. This is an API that we&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while, and it&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s really specifically user-facing in its functionality but makes a lot of work streamlined for everyday developers, whether you are building something for yourself, for your family, or for a client. This whole project probably is gonna really speak to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hi, guys, and welcome to the show. First-time guests, both of you. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yes. First time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Well, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, like your name, what you do with WordPress, how you contribute to the project, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I can go first. My name is Ryan Welcher. I&#8217;m a developer advocate and sponsored by Automattic. Then, I contribute full-time to the WordPress project by creating documentation, doing live streams, creating videos, and just generally trying to be helpful in in the space to help engineers and extenders work with the various APIs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love the just generally trying to be helpful part. Mario, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Mario:</strong> He really is. He really does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m Mario Santos. I&#8217;m also a sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m more focused on the project management and developer. I consider myself a mix of both. Right now I&#8217;m working on projects that are focused on improving the developer experience especially. That can go from the Block API to the Interactivity API; that is the topic today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Very nice. Very nice. Just lots of helping that everyone&#8217;s trying to do. I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about the Interactivity API today. And, Mario, I believe it was almost a year ago that you first put this proposal out into the WordPress project. Do you wanna tell us a little bit about just, like, where the idea of this came from? Like, I know it wasn&#8217;t originally called the Interactivity API, but, like, what was you said you do some a bit of product, a bit of development. Like, what was it about this idea that was so important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:48] <strong>Mario:</strong> Yeah. Sure. So, basically, well, the proposal came, like, one year ago, but it has been in the works, like, for many years, I would say. Just to give a bit more context, previously, before being a sponsored contributor, I was working at a startup called Frontity Framework, and we were building a React framework to enable rich user experiences on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So basically, it was a framework for headless WordPress. And at some point, we became sponsored contributors, the idea was to bring those user experiences to those rich and cool websites that lead to WordPress. So, you don&#8217;t need an external framework to create them, and you can do that directly in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where the idea of the Interactivity API comes from. From there, we started exploring different possibilities and tailoring it more to WordPress to ensure it works with its APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think after many many months working on that, the Interactivity API is the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I just wanted to note that you started that answer with, like, the proposal was about a year ago, but the work had been happening for a long time. I think that&#8217;s generally true, and it&#8217;s not something that we always really acknowledge. This happens with patents also. This is going to be a strange tangent, but this is how we do in in my brain. This is how my brain works. So frequently, you&#8217;ll see a brand new product, but the patent for it was, like, 30 years beforehand, like, way before you ever see anything. And I think that&#8217;s kinda how this works also with software development. Like, the idea, has been going for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The problem was identified a long time ago. And by the time you see something that helps to solve the problem or bring a new set of features to you, like, you didn&#8217;t know, but it had been being worked on for, like, five years or something. And I think that&#8217;s such a fascinating thing. That&#8217;s always apparent to me, but I think it&#8217;s not really apparent for a lot of people in the, in I don&#8217;t know, who use software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna say in the space, quote, unquote, but that&#8217;s not even it. Like, it&#8217;s the people who are using software. We don&#8217;t know how long anything&#8217;s been under development. We just know that at some point, a magical thing appeared, and we get to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So speaking of the problems that we have identified that we&#8217;re trying to solve with this. Like, was there an inherent problem that you all were trying to solve as you were coming up with this idea around the Interactivity API itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say that trying to summarize it, it covers many things, but the main problem was that creating those kinds of interactions in the client was kind of difficult. You had to manage many things many tools, and each developer could come up with different solutions, and maybe they don&#8217;t combine well together. So, the idea is to provide an extended way so developers don&#8217;t have to take care of many things. They just have to take care of the interactions they wanna create. And ensuring that it works well with the WordPress way, it works well with the block system, and any block created with this Interactivity API can communicate with each other. You can combine those blocks, and you are not gonna encounter any problem. So, I would say that the main issue we were trying to solve is that there wasn&#8217;t a standard solution. There were different approaches taken by different developers, and that could create some issues. So, until now, Gutenberg has been mainly focused on the editor side and how blocks are created. And this is a first attempt to to cover the part of the front end, the interactions that users may want to create in the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Ryan:</strong> It solves a ton of problems. But, I mean, coming from someone like, I have a fair amount of agency experience. I&#8217;ve been, you know, you&#8217;re working on large projects. And every time someone solves a problem, they solve it slightly differently. And that&#8217;s problematic because you switch teams or, you know, someone else picks up the code base, and all of a sudden, now they have to learn your custom system that&#8217;s slightly different from the one that I built last week and the one that, you know, someone else built two weeks earlier. And this takes the guesswork out. It takes the sort of the plumbing out of the equation. One of the reasons I really loves working with WordPress when I started working with WordPress was that when I was building for clients, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building the CMS. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building a menu system or figuring out how to handle media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I just had to do the things that that client was paying me to do. Like, I just had to make their site look the way that they wanted it to. And with the Interactivity API, I think there&#8217;s a bit of that where I don&#8217;t have to worry about figuring out how am I gonna get all these pieces to talk to each other on the front end. It&#8217;s all there. I just have to connect the dots, and it makes it very, very simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m building the site right now for a workshop that I&#8217;m gonna be giving a WordCamp Asia, which is a a shameless plug. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Coming up so fast, y&#8217;all. WordCamp Asia is, like, two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. I have so much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve built an entire voting system on a website where people can pick what we&#8217;re going to be talking about in my workshop, and I built it in the Interactivity API, and it took me, you know, probably five hours. And that&#8217;s me trying to learn some things and mess around with it. And to do that without the Interactivity API would have probably been an entire React-based, you know, completely outside of WordPress. I would have loaded one thing on the page and had it build out my whole application, and now I&#8217;m doing it with blocks and I&#8217;m doing it with a block theme. So if I wanna move those blocks around. I can move the blocks around. I can change anything that I wanna change inside of WordPress the way I would normally, and all that in interactivity just still works. And that&#8217;s It&#8217;s awesome. I just I love it. I can&#8217;t like, the Interactivity API, not my website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also both. Like, it can be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> I wanted to say that I think it&#8217;s a great point. I like to think about it like having the best of both worlds. Right now, we have modern frameworks like React, Vue that are used to create these cool websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the Interactivity API plus WordPress brings everything together. Like, you can create those cool user experiences while keeping the full power of WordPress, its management system, the Block editor, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything like that out there. Like having the best of both both worlds because we are still working with blocks, and that&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Given that it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s not even been released yet. Like, it&#8217;s coming very soon. But.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. This is all still in the Gutenberg plugin. So, like, if you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, get the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> But just how mature the API is now, considering it is still kind of not even fully released, it&#8217;s only gonna get better? I just think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, kudos to Mario and your team for doing all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve a question that I think probably, Ryan, you can start with, but then also probably, Mario, you&#8217;re gonna have some opinions on also. In this conversation so far, we&#8217;ve done a lot of, like, when you want to have these interactions and also when you want to have these cool experiences. For folks who actually do not know what the Interactivity API is yet, and they don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about when we say these interactions like, what exactly are we talking about from a user perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what types of things will users be able to see when they are experiencing the Interactivity API&#8217;s features and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a great question. From a user standpoint, it&#8217;ll just look like your regular website, I think. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing. So, like the interactions that we&#8217;re talking about is when you&#8217;re in the browser and you wanna click a button and expand something, for example, or you wanna click an image and have the lightbox pop-up, which is in core now, that&#8217;s driven by the Interactivity API, but these interactions are basically when a user wants to interact with something, what it does. That&#8217;s a really generic way of saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Our current favorite example and, Ryan, it sounds like you also have another example. But our current favorite example is like a movie collection site, you know? And so, like, when we&#8217;re talking about what the Interactivity API is going to power, it&#8217;s things like, when you favorite a series of movies, and then you can, and it just updates that on the fly, and you&#8217;ll be able to in essentially real-time as instant as reasonably possible based on your computer and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, then look at your list of things that you favorited or things like that. Like, for folks who don&#8217;t understand interactive site like, all of us know that that, like, if you get on a site, you have interacted with it. But when we&#8217;re talking about Interactivity API, we&#8217;re talking about types of direct actions users can take. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just only triggered by some actions. It could be scrolling, clicking, or, or whatever. But, it can go from a simple example like drop down or a popover to more complex things like the movies demo, where you can navigate and the page is not reloading, and that allows you to play a trailer. It starts in a pop-up, and you can keep navigating through different pages, and the trailer keeps playing without reloading. Another example could be instant search; like you start typing the search, and it directly updates the list of films, in this case, that are shown, those kinds of things that happen In the browser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And Ryan said you, you said that you, like, built a whole survey system, A whole polling system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah, a voting system. So there&#8217;s a series of buttons, each one representing a certain topic, and people can vote, and it tallies the amount. So each, I&#8217;m calling them recipes, has amount of time associated with it, and then so you vote until you run out of time, at which point, like in its tracking it all, and it&#8217;s showing you how much time you voted, how much is left, and once you&#8217;ve run out of time it blurs like it disables all of the voting buttons so you can&#8217;t add more because you run out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So if you remove one, you can add again. It&#8217;s very, very powerful. And, like, before the Interactivity API, you would have to have, I would have built that whole thing in React, and it would have been one single application that just get loaded on a page. And I just think it&#8217;s amazing. And, like the, the ability to create what are called, like, single page applications or what have always sort of been called SPAs or single page applications where you&#8217;re not reloading the browser every single time you click on a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to do some things to make that work, but that&#8217;s just available to you and in WordPress. That&#8217;s amazing. I just think that&#8217;s so neat. I mean, it&#8217;s already powering things like the Query Loop block has the ability to move pagination without reloading the page, which is, sounds like a sort of a like a okay, great, like sort of, you know, mundane thing but imagine you had two or three different query loops sitting on your homepage and you wanted to be able to paginate through each one and not refresh the page. That&#8217;s a fantastic user experience that now is just enabled and otherwise was not possible prior to the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I feel like the Query Loop block was, like, a three-year project four years ago. And I had forgotten about it, which is surprising because I was so concerned with it when we were working directly on it all the time. But yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve talked about kind of the user thing and people who are gonna build stuff for clients. But, like, if you&#8217;re a contributor and you want to figure out more about either how to use this or how to expand on what is already there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We already talked about how it&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s kind of experimental over there. But, like, do you all have like, good first bugs? Things that can be worked on in there? Or is there, like, an experiment zone where people can just be like, this is what I tried with the Interactivity API until it broke? How do people work with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would like to clarify first, it&#8217;s right now, it&#8217;s private in, it&#8217;s a private API in WordPress core in 6.4, And it&#8217;s public in Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s gonna be a public API already in WordPress 6.5. So, yes. Anyone can start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get involved is first sharing what interactions you want to see. I mean, everyone has different ideas, and we will love to know the interactions that people want to create using the Interactivity API, so that would be the first step. Then, test it, create your own blocks or site, and send feedback what do you like what you don&#8217;t like. Raise issues, and for that, we are mainly using GitHub. We created a new category in GitHub in the Gutenberg plugin discussions, and we try to to keep everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So if you have any questions any feedback, you can share it there. You can also find more discussions about the road map, the change log, many things that are going on right now. And, yeah, I would say those are the ways of getting involved, and I can also expect, maybe Ryan can tell you more here, to start working more on tutorials or videos or whatever. And for me, personally, I would love to see the community working on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah. I can, yeah. I think that from a contributor standpoint, especially those who are trying to get into contributing, because, I mean, it&#8217;s not not complicated. Let&#8217;s put it that way, like the Interactivity API. And that&#8217;s not meaning to be a barrier to anyone, but a great place to start is documentation. A great place to start is going through those docs and making sure they&#8217;re up to date and, you know, saying, oh, well, that&#8217;s supposed to do this, so let me go try that. And if it works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, file a bug, update the documentation, that&#8217;s a great way to get started. It&#8217;s gonna familiarize yourself with the code base and what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And then, sort of, just through osmosis, you&#8217;ll start to pick up more about it. And for anyone starting to contribute to the WordPress project in general, I would say starting with documentation or unit testing is a really, really great way to kinda, dip your toe in the water and not feel too frustrated. And tutorials and demos and show us what you&#8217;re building. We wanna see it. I mean, send it to me, and I will show everyone that I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I mean, we wanna see what what people are building with it and because, you know, just like WordPress, I always use this example, but, like, people used to hack WordPress until we got a hook added for that particular thing that they were adding. So, if we don&#8217;t know what people are building or wanting to build with it, we can&#8217;t make those things happen. So knowing what people are building, how they&#8217;re building, and what they can&#8217;t build, what they&#8217;re running into, what issues they&#8217;re running into is the best way to contribute. So, so people smarter than me can build it for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that call out, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, the theory of tech adoption. And for things like the Interactivity API where we&#8217;re still kind of in the early adopter phase like, Ryan, you&#8217;re an early adopter. You&#8217;re doing everything you think you want to be able to do until it breaks. And, like, I love, like, test it till it fails as a concept of how to get involved in something because, like, you&#8217;re just experimenting, and we encourage experimentation in open source and in open source software and certainly in WordPress. And so, like, it is an unusual thing to think of, like, the best way that I can give back to this project, that I can contribute to this project and make sure that it continues to succeed long term is by using it until the wheels fall off and then tell people what made the wheels fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that is a change in thought, But you&#8217;re right. Like, it&#8217;s a very old school open source idea to just get in there and see where it breaks, and tell us. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all we need. And I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But I just passed my 9-year anniversary being a sponsored contributor, and I was in WordPress for a little bit before it. And so, like, I&#8217;m officially the old guard of us, and so the fact that I&#8217;m, like, so excited about the fact that people are gonna come in and break Mario&#8217;s stuff. Mario, don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s how it works. But also, like, I do find that very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m willing to see how people break things; that&#8217;s what we need. I totally agree with your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. So I do have kind of, just, like, a final question for y&#8217;all. If there were one thing that you wanted the people who are listening to the WordPress Briefing to know about the Interactivity API, like a hidden gem, a little secret trick. Like, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Mario:</strong> For me, the most exciting part of the Interactivity API is the functionality the client-side navigation enables because there are many, many things there. And I&#8217;m sure that there are many things we haven&#8217;t thought about yet, and the community will come up with some ideas and that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Ryan:</strong> For me, the thing is, I love how integrated it is with WordPress, and I know a lot of thought has gone into that without getting too into the weeds. The reasons the decisions that were made were made was so all the hooks and filters and all that goodness that we&#8217;ve had for 20 years is still gonna work. And with the HTML API, the tag processor stuff that&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, it&#8217;s just so cool. It works so well with WordPress. It just works and that&#8217;s probably it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I work with it, I&#8217;m not having to do any weird janky filtering or stuff that, like, you know, the things that I want to do are not hindered by the Interactivity API. The rather, I&#8217;m able to do more things because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> I prefer Ryan&#8217;s answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Mario:</strong> It&#8217;s something really important and it&#8217;s something we usually take for granted that it just works with WordPress APIs and the Block Editor, but if you think more about it, it&#8217;s amazing. Like, It&#8217;s what makes it really powerful, I I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For what it&#8217;s worth, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of, like, the R&amp;D type things that we&#8217;re working on in the project right now. Right? Across Our ecosystem, like WP Playground. It is mind-boggling how progressive that is as a concept, and we currently have, like, you know, 25 ideas about what we could do with it, and we&#8217;re currently working on, like, five because we&#8217;ve got two and a half developers on it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like, the expectation that it will just work is there for everybody who has, is not part of the R&amp;D process, but for everyone else who&#8217;s, like, been watching its development over time, shocking. Shocking that it works at all. Not because it wasn&#8217;t supposed to work, but because, like, if someone had asked you five years ago if it was gonna be possible to run WordPress development environments locally and then also just export it and import it into whatever host you want. Like, without a host, without a server, we would all think that you were nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Amazing what&#8217;s happening there and, like, some of the things that we&#8217;re seeing, people who are, like, researching with AI in the WordPress space doing? Equally shocking. All of these things. Like, had you said anything to me about it five years ago, I&#8217;d be like, well, that is a mystery. So, every once in a while, I do have wild ideas about things that I wish we could do with our software. And so yesterday, I went and looked at a prototype for something that someone built based on a wish that I had in 2019. In 2019, I was like, you can play Skyrim on an Amazon Dot using just your voice. So like, why can&#8217;t we build a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then in 2021, someone prototyped that for me. It was ridiculous. It was very bad. It was hilarious. But, also, like, it took 35 minutes to create a &#8216;Hello world&#8217; page, which was ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, like, what we&#8217;re looking at, the research that I keep seeing from that AI space is people saying, like, I&#8217;m gonna put in a plain text prompt. I need a website as a yoga instructor who also makes custom hats. Right? And then, like, poof. You have this thing that kinda looks like a website with your basic functions and features using the blocks that we have created for WordPress. Like it&#8217;s fascinating how far it&#8217;s come. And that&#8217;s in 2021. It was literally impossible the last time that I was talking about it with anyone, equally literally impossible. Everyone&#8217;s like, plain language prompts for stuff, like that is just a pipe dream. Get away from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I keep seeing, like, these demos of the research, and it&#8217;s not as far away as we all thought it was. For all these things, Playground, Interactivity API, The AI research is being done. Like, we&#8217;re just a walking R&amp;D group over here in WordPress, and I love it. It&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re just making the impossible possible every day, and I think that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sorry. I got really sidetracked. Do y&#8217;all have anything that you wanted to be sure to share about either the Interactivity API or anything that&#8217;s coming up? Something you wanna make that our listeners know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would just like to emphasize that we love feedback. Please share your feedback. If you test it, yeah, if you think it&#8217;s bad feedback, share it with us as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s especially the feedback we like. I don&#8217;t like this part. That&#8217;s great. We we want to know because the idea is that it serves all purposes for this kind of interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That nothing new, but I would like to emphasize that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You know what? There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re good. You should always tell people what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Ryan:</strong> If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with the Interactivity API and just don&#8217;t have any idea where to begin, there&#8217;s actually a pack there. There&#8217;s a Create Block template. So the Create Block package allows you to to quickly scaffold blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a template that&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg repository. It&#8217;s been published on it and NPM. And it will scaffold a very simple block out for you and it&#8217;ll give you, it&#8217;ll show you all the plumbing and how all the pieces work together. So, I think that&#8217;s a fantastic place to get started. It&#8217;s a very simple block. It just basically shows and hides a message, but it&#8217;s all done via the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s a really, really great sort of, like, like, &#8216;Hello world&#8217; style. I&#8217;m gonna shamelessly self-promote myself at WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Asia this year doing a workshop where I will be doing some stuff with your Interactivity API. But, if you&#8217;re there and you wanna chat more about the Interactivity API, I am all ears, and I love talking about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Cool. Ryan, Mario thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So I hope that you all find that whole project as fascinating as I find it. The Interactivity API is, I know, something that we&#8217;ve kind of been talking about for a while. It showed up specifically in State of the Word, and it&#8217;s hard to understand how important, how vital that work is going to be until you really get your hands on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you get in there. You take a look at it. I think also Ryan has a few live streams that he does, and he&#8217;s planning on a couple for the Interactivity API coming up. And so just keep an eye out for all of that as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a bunch of feedback and documentation. So, first things first. Did you know that the Documentation Team holds an online monthly Contributor Day on the fourth Tuesday of every month. It&#8217;s just an online docs day, and I love it. So, the next one that&#8217;s coming up is February 27th. We&#8217;re looking for folks to help. So show up, figure out how to get some docs done, and make the WordPress project easier to follow, one bit of documentation at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I have is a request for feedback. So, we announced in December that we have a new centralized WordPress events landing page on WordPress.org, and we wanted to give more visibility to all kinds of WordPress events across the globe. But as always, we really could use your feedback about what is useful for you, what you had hoped to see, what you didn&#8217;t see. So, leave your comments with any relevant feedback about how you would improve those pages and the text on it. If you&#8217;re missing anything relevant, if there are ideas that you have for what could be there, all ideas are welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the third thing that I have on our list today is another documentation thing. So, over the last year, a group of contributors have been working to improve the block development onboarding experience within the Block Editor handbook. That contains over 400 published pages, and the effort in 2023 to kind of overhaul that and make it easier was just the beginning. So, it&#8217;s a daunting task. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s complex, but improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the WordPress project, especially If there are just quick fixes like typos or formatting. Feedback on the existing content, such as the new block tutorial, is invaluable. And so, if you have not taken a look at those yet, wander over to the show notes, click a link or two, take a look, get some feedback to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

This reflects project-wide efforts to increase utilization of these respectively. However, positive sentiment about WordPress is down modestly, and more so among contributors. The analysis of the annual survey highlights certain areas that could benefit from increased attention in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the highlights split into three parts: logistics, general trends, and contributor sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logistics</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Completions were up 17% in 2023, though short of a goal to double them, despite increased promotion and partnership with some hosting partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Polyglots team translated the survey from English into 9 different languages, the most ever for the survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Debuted a new platform, Alchemer, for improved accessibility, usability, data collection, administration, and analysis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The completion rate increased again from last year’s high of 63% to 79% in 2023, proving that investing some time in the new platform and clarifying wording was well worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General trends</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>NPS* was 30.1 overall, with contributors at 27.9 and non-contributors at 32. The NPS has trended downward since 2021, when it was 45. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>60% of respondents indicate usage of Gutenberg, 8% are unsure, and 12% use something other than Gutenberg and/or the Classic Editor. This is up from 2022 (54%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>45% of respondents indicate that the WordPress Site Editor meets their site-building needs, 26% are indifferent, and 29% disagree.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61% of respondents indicate familiarity with block themes and plugins. While this question was not asked previously, in 2022, 53% said they had used blocks<br>“In the new site editor.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security, performance, and stability were the top three critical areas respondents considered when building their website, plugin, theme, or style variation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63% agree that WordPress is as good or better than other CMSs, down from 68% in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents indicated that the best things about WordPress are that it is open source, has ample plugin options, incorporates good customization, is easy to use, and offers flexibility. This is similar to 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limitless configurations, performance, scalability, accessibility, integration, hosting, and support all saw 100% or more increases compared to 2022 regarding favorite things about WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents cited “too many plugins,” “the site editing experience,” “security,” and “performance” as the top four worst things about WordPress. Most interestingly, though, 16% indicated that none of the 20 topics were terrible, and there was a 43% decrease in the number of people indicating that “site editing is difficult to learn.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search engines and YouTube continue to be the two most common resources for finding information about WordPress, while those writing about WordPress, in general, saw a sharp decline year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor sentiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>58% of self-identified contributors to WordPress said they agree with the project’s roadmap plans for “Phase 3” and “Phase 4” as a good plan to enhance the WordPress experience for developers, creators, and publishers alike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While about one-third of respondents indicated they contribute to the WordPress project, only about half knew how to get involved, knew about WordCamps and meetups, understood the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, and knew the benefits of open source.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of 22 topics, the distribution of the top three things that WordPress needs to focus on from the perspective of contributors was broad, with only a 13.5% raw percentage point (1350 basis points) difference between performance (18.6%) in first position and collaborative editing (5.1%) in 22nd position. This shows a need for more consensus among contributors regarding where to focus resources and/or illustrates that the project has many essential elements with passionate supporters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fewer contributors had a positive experience in 2023 (55%) versus 2022 (64%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the feeling of being welcome in the WordPress community among contributors decreased to 57% versus 64% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furthermore, contributors feel appropriately recognized less in 2023 (46%) than in 2022 (51%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 annual WordPress survey participation and results highlight the possibility of survey burnout within the WordPress community and some declining overall satisfaction among contributors. There is an opportunity to increase awareness regarding critical initiatives such as WordCamps and other resources for WordPress users and contributors alike and to increase messaging on improvements made within the project to the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s planned for 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the survey’s questions further to ensure they continue to provide valuable insight into the project’s trends. This means some questions will be replaced while others might be refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, plans are being explored to distribute and promote the survey at each of the three annual flagship WordCamps (Europe, U.S., and Asia). This would be in contrast to a single yearly survey. More exploration on this topic will take place in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/02/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey-Results-Deck.pdf\">View the 2023 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reporting.alchemer.com/r/738278_655bbaa5598b14.93675163\">View a web-based version of the results.</a> <em>Note that this link may expire in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score-calculation\">What is NPS?</a> Simply put, NPS is a KPI organizations can use to measure how likely it’s [users, clients, members] are to recommend a product or service.

You’ll find more ways to manage your fonts and styles, notable upgrades to synced patterns, a collection of Site Editor and performance updates to help you get things done, and new ways to leverage design tools in Classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will include breakthrough foundational APIs that will start to transform how you use blocks to build memorable experiences. This release invites you to dig into these early-stage frameworks, discover how you’d like to see them evolve, and have an impact on their future improvements and capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excited yet? Keep reading for some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially slated for release in WordPress 6.4, the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59166\">Font Library</a> is one of those great things worth the wait. It gives you new capabilities for efficiently managing a vital piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Font Library, you can handle fonts across your site regardless of your active theme—much like how you manage assets in the Media Library. You can install local fonts or Google Fonts, and it’s easily extensible, with the ability to add your own custom typography collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synced patterns get an upgrade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/\">Synced patterns</a> bring efficiency to the design process, letting you make global changes to particular layouts with minimal effort. However, there’s often a need to make contextual changes when it comes to content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 introduces new enhancements to synced patterns that let you override the content in each specific instance. You can choose what content can be updated within a synced pattern—while maintaining the design and layout you’ve already created. Use it for templated pieces like recipes, testimonials, or case studies that use recurring elements to frame unique content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This major release will introduce overrides for the Paragraph, Image, Heading, and Button blocks, with support for more blocks to come as work on synced patterns continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting blocks and custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will finally make it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53300#issuecomment-1938463648\">connect core block attributes to custom fields</a>. This capability lets you use the value of a custom field without creating custom blocks. For example, a digital publication could use custom fields with Paragraph and Image blocks. It could pull information from its individual staff writer profiles to dynamically display on its team page, like headshots and names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">Block Bindings API</a> powers this functionality and is designed to be extensible enough for developers to connect blocks to any dynamic content—not just custom fields. If your data is stored elsewhere, you can easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first step in a larger project to simplify how custom fields and other dynamic content are managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API gets baked into Core</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as just a taste in WordPress 6.4 with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">lightbox feature for images</a> is officially making its way into Core. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks\">Interactivity API</a> is a new framework that offers developers a standardized method to bring interactive front-end experiences, or interactions, to blocks. It aims to simplify the process, with less dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interactions create engaging user experiences, whether showing new comments or fetching search results without reloading a page, allowing visitors to interact with content in real time, or incorporating effects like countdowns and transitional animations that surprise and delight. Check out <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">this demo site to get a taste of what this framework can do</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.5 is just the beginning of bringing this developer experience into Core. Find out how you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56803\">follow along with the work or lend a hand</a> and test more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more from your revisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions are the markers of progress. For creative projects, they&#8217;re also a welcome fallback when you&#8217;re working through a new design or concept. This release brings more detail to your style revision history in the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/22/core-editor-improvement-robust-revisions-in-the-site-editor/\">Style revisions in 6.5</a> present a more detailed picture of your work, with design updates like time stamps, quick summaries that outline changes, and the ability to see a full list of revisions made—not just the previous 100. View revisions from the Style Book to see changes that aren&#8217;t reflected in the template you&#8217;re working on. Style revisions are also newly available for templates and template parts, giving you a broader view of your site’s changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">work happening to expand and improve revisions across the WordPress experience</a>. It’s a foundational part of the collaborative editing and workflows focus of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classic themes can opt into appearance tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the design experience in Block themes evolves and improves, many of these upgrades are also available for Classic themes. Theme authors can choose to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60118\">add support for appearance tools to any Classic theme</a>—even without the use of theme.json. Opting in gives designers and site creators using Classic themes access to a varied set of design options, from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-theme-json.php#L576\">spacing and border controls to typography and color options</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching themes can feel like a big undertaking, and for folks who aren’t ready to jump into the flexibility of Block themes, these pathways to adoption can help ease that tension. Once a Classic theme gets initial support for appearance tools, more design options will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More design tools are on the way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each WordPress release brings more thought and attention to the way you can create with the Site Editor. The latest improvements to the design experience help bring your creative vision to life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/57005\">Background images for Group blocks get size and repeat support</a>, letting you play with subtle or splashy ways to add visual interest to your layouts.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56897\">Aspect ratio support for the Cover block</a> gives you more control over your Cover block images’ shape and size.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57103\">Shadow support added to more blocks</a> to help create layouts with visual depth or add a little personality to your design.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Site Editor updates to streamline your workflow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring ease and simplicity to your site-building process with the latest advancements to the Site Editor’s capabilities, from important interface improvements to upgraded tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going beyond Group blocks, you can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54426\">rename every block in the List View</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55188\">rename</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55292\">duplicate</a> individual patterns to help keep them organized. Other notable UI improvements add access to your block settings with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50273\">quick right-click from List View</a>, adjust preferences with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56510\">consolidated settings in the Editor preferences panel</a>, and the ability to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56295\">block toolbar on hover when you’re in Distraction Free mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also notice a cleaner and more unified link-building experience that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50891\">improves link controls</a>, making it easier to create and manage links in various blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release has a bounty of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33683\">drag-and-drop enhancements</a> to make your editing experience feel more intuitive. You’ll notice helpful visual adjustments, like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56625\">displaced items in List View</a> when you drag them around to reorganize. You’ll also find that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56070\">drag and drop anywhere you’d like</a> in the Editor, from the very beginning to the end of your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Data Views in the Site Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every piece of your site comes with a library of information and data. Organizing it, finding what you need, and making informed changes should be as effortless as your site editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 includes <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/55083\">data views</a> for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts. You can view data in a table or grid view, with a new UI for toggling fields and making bulk changes. It’s a refreshing and feature-rich experience that leads the way for the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">Admin Redesign project</a> on the WordPress roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin dependencies improve the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 improves <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57545\">how users manage plugins that require other plugins</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs from the WordPress.org Plugins repository, which will present users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Required plugins must remain active and installed for as long as plugins that require them are active and installed. If any required plugins become inactive or uninstalled, the plugins that require them will be automatically deactivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big performance gains across the editing experience and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 contains more than 110 performance-related updates, including an impressive <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">increase in speed and efficiency</a> across both the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed increasing to nearly four times faster than the previous release. You’ll also find yourself navigating through the Site Editor six times faster than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loading time for translated sites gets a boost due to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merging Performant Translations into Core</a>. This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that WordPress remains highly accessible is crucial for its success and fulfilling the mission of democratizing publishing. With this in mind, 6.5 will ship more than 65 updates to improve accessibility throughout the platform. These updates include fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.

feature Sunita Rai, a content marketer originally from a remote village in the hills of Nepal. Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1536%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;<br><br>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, it is February. For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br><br>[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser or specifically for this one; if you liked what you heard, share it with a fellow collaborator whether they know WordPress or not. But if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at wpbriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, we&#8217;ve got a throwback episode about blogging. If you&#8217;re like me, you sometimes miss the early days of blogs, where the words were a little more pensive, and the images were a little less professional. If you&#8217;re on a slow hobby journey like so many of us are right now, give this one a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:58] (music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning. You may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their own project or business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool. We have long since outgrown that, but even 20 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because, even after those 20 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same, and that is to democratize publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help people have a place online where they can tell their stories, or share their projects, or set up their businesses. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So, I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, Oh, Jospeha, how old fashioned. I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website. And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first-ever website. So let&#8217;s dive in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So, have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, but also some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first, cause like, if you want the domain name WordPress.org, like, we own that, you can&#8217;t have that. But if you know that you want a domain like &#8216;WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com&#8217; like, that one might be more available. And if you know kind of the words you want in your domain, then you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mention all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it&#8217;s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start before you even know what WordPress is most of the time. So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is, what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date. There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service, where they will keep your WordPress software up to date and provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So it ranges all the way from full service like that, all the way down to essentially zero service, just kind of hands off. They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site, but they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you; they leave updating up to you, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself and the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software, and what you want, and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either services with the existing host that you chose or moving to a different host; however, that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually, most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click, and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, on the other side of that spectrum, that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server, or you know how to work in this thing called cPanel, etc. So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to WordPress.org/download and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment. Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little, I&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the LearnWP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host, as well as various other early steps of this process. If you felt like I blazed through all of that, which, honestly, I kind of did. You can work through those lessons in that course at your own pace, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this &#8216;Hello World&#8217; post. There&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare, like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMSs in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh. We&#8217;ve got now a website. We know kind of how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can be moderated, and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some choose-your-own-adventure guiding questions here. Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words? Mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want, three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to WordPress.org/themes and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to WordPress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically, so that you can see how things look right away. And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site, so if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely. And just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every WordPress instance ships with a theme, and it is fully functional when you get your site up and running, so you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready. And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites, is to add plugins to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality to it. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions? If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there. If that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find. And as a general side note here as well, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine. I&#8217;ll tell you this, I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms, and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So, yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the one hand, you definitely can. And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem and, obviously, hear some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Josepha</strong>: Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for for years, but also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009, and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy. We are the easiest of the hard options for CMSs like content management systems are just complicated. But we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game like you should have had a website for years, I mean, sure, that could be true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time to plant that tree is today. WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now, our small list of big things. Today we&#8217;ve got some look-back items and some look-forward items. So let&#8217;s hop right in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing is we have a year in review with the themes team. So much amazing work has been done by the themes team over the past year, both for reviewing themes and creating them. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to those in the show notes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a post out that just has some general celebrations from teams around the community. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that. It probably has been linked in quite a few places, but you know, we don&#8217;t always embrace those moments of celebration. We don&#8217;t always embrace our wins. And so it&#8217;s always good to share those early and often. There are probably more than just those two. So if you posted one or you saw a really interesting one that you think that we should know about, don&#8217;t forget to share it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Next, we have a leap into 2024 with Site Editor tools. So, on the new Developer Blog, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, there is a lot of excellent content there for whether you are like an advanced developer in WordPress or you&#8217;re kind of intermediate and ready to move into your advanced developer era.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Editor will give you a powerful way to visually create every part of your site and tell your story. And this post will help you to kind of see how to handle everything from big style changes to simple copy updates, all in a single place. We want to make sure that you get the most out of your WordPress this year. And that post will give you a few standout tools and features that you&#8217;ll want to try.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll also want to keep an eye out for updates as we move into 2024 around team reps. So each team in the WordPress project goes through a process to review and elect team reps, and elections are happening now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Along with things that are happening now that you should keep an eye on, the annual goals, our big picture post has gone out as well. It went out at the end of the week last week. There&#8217;ll be a link to all of these in the show notes. And yeah, keep an eye out for, hopefully, a fantastic 2024 in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. And if you like what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser, or if you have questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPbriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:57] (Music outro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"16745\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Data Liberation in 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/data-liberation-in-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:58:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16736\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:314:\"Imagine a more open web where people can switch between any platform of their choosing.

Migrating your site to WordPress, or exporting all your content from WordPress, should be possible in one click. I want WordPress’ export format to become the lingua franca of CMSes, whether coming to WordPress or moving within WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often hear about folks across the WordPress community duplicating efforts when creating scripts and workflows to move users to WordPress. Imagine if we shared those resources instead and built community-owned plugins that anyone could use! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it should be more than plugins; workflows, tutorials, and helper scripts should be shared, too. I want this resource to have space to include moving from social networks, moving from a page builder to core blocks, switching from classic to blocks, and improving WordPress current canonical plugins for importing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You can help!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the heart of any open source project is the community that shows up to build it. My hope is that this marks the start of a new contribution pathway, separate from core teams, that allows folks to contribute what they’ve learned and what they’ve created to help others move to WordPress. I expect this emphasis on migration will also influence future development, both in core and with recommended community or canonical plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that I think will be key to making this project a success:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A dedicated landing page on WordPress.org following a WordPress.org/and/[platform-name] format.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A forum used for non-review user feedback and general discussion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A dedicated Slack channel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderation within hours rather than days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Listed on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress\">WordPress GitHub</a> with syncing for individual commits to SVN for history in both places.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By complementing the community’s existing efforts—the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future program</a>, the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress initiative</a>, a focus on internationalization, etc.—my hope is that this will help even more people see themselves in the WordPress project, providing fresh momentum for <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/\">WordCamps and meetups</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s never been more crucial to champion openness on the web.

Custom fields have been around for a long time. What wasn&#8217;t available was a way for content creators / no-code site builders to read out the values of custom fields without using plugins like ACF or Metabox, etc. To include values from Custom fields on Theme templates, you also need a developer to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This first iteration is mostly for developers. Justin Tadlock published <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/02/20/introducing-block-bindings-part-1-connecting-custom-fields/\">Introducing Block Bindings, part 1: connecting custom fields</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s only enabled for heading, buttons, paragraphs, and image blocks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The binding sources are either <code>core/patterns</code> or <code>core/post-meta</code>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The feature does come with a way to register additional binding sources for your plugin or theme.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A way to add or edit custom fields via the block editor is missing. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might ask why should I bother? And you&#8217;d be right. Whether you are a no-code site builder or site owner, don&#8217;t quit just yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Custom Fields have been part of WordPress since the Stone Age, there is a way to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/assign-custom-fields/\">add and modify custom fields</a>. The good ol&#8217; meta boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Bindings will open so many possibilities that many users have been longing for since the start of blocks in 2017. I found the feature so intriguing that I wondered if I could make it work now using as little code as possible. And with a minimal squinting in the code editor, you can start using it, too. Even if only as a proof of concept. There is the little warning: Use this in production at your own risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a rundown of my idea:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each blog post is part of a logbook, which reports what happened today&#8211; including a note about the weather, which then appears above the title of a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-21-at-11.10.24.png?resize=652%2C419&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27547\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the broad steps to accomplish this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use the good ol&#8217; meta box to add a note about today&#8217;s weather to the blog post</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use a block to read the post-meta value, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add the block to the single post template, with some styling and a drop-shadow.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The middle step is the meat of the matter, and that&#8217;s where the squinting skill comes in.  If you know how to use meta boxes to create custom fields, you can skip over the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#blockbinding\">next section right to the middle step. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to use Meta boxes to create a Custom Field</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to enable Custom Fields for the post editor via the Preference menu . Go to the 3-dot Options menu and select <strong>Preferences</strong>. But before you go there, make sure you saved all your changes to the post. To show the meta boxes below the post, the block editor needs to reload the page, and unsaved content would be removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a short video.</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>You can add a new custom field called &#8220;Weather&#8221; to the post and add the value: &#8220;Sunny with a chance of rain in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>For subsequent posts you can select the name of the Custom field from the dropdown box and add the value.</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>That was our short discourse on handling Custom Fields with WordPress. Now we apply your knowledge a bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"blockbinding\">Block Binding Block markup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentation for the Block Bindings shows how you can use the block markup to add information about the meta field (aka Custom field) to the block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The template looks like this: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kevinbatdorf-code-block-pro\"><span></span><span tabindex=\"0\" class=\"code-block-pro-copy-button\"></span><pre class=\"shiki solarized-light\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span>&lt;!--</span><span> wp:</span><span>paragraph</span><span> {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>     </span><span>\"metadata\"</span><span>:{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>        </span><span>\"bindings\"</span><span>:{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>          </span><span>\"content\"</span><span>:{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            </span><span>\"source\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"core/post-meta\"</span><span>,</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            </span><span>\"args\"</span><span>:{</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>              </span><span>\"key\"</span><span>:</span><span>\"Weather\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>              }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>             }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>            }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>         }</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>      } </span><span>--&gt;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>&lt;!--</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>wp:</span><span>paragraph</span><span> </span><span>--&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>source</code> parameter identifies the place where the system looks for the information. Here it says, &#8220;core/post-meta.&#8221; That&#8217;s the space where custom fields and their values are stored. In the <code>args</code> section, it asks for the key of the custom field, that&#8217;s the name, which is &#8220;Weather&#8221; in our case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it can be a bit intimidating.  You need to enter the code editor for a minute to add this to your post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, here comes the hard part for non-coders. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use the copy button on the right of the code block to add the content to your clipboard.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Switch to the code editor via the <strong>Options</strong> menu or use the Keyboard shortcut. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then  paste the code above into the code editor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Save everything and exit the code editor. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>When you return to the visual editor, you only see one word in the space where the block went: Weather. Don&#8217;t worry, that&#8217;s a little downside of this process, there is no preview in the editor. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the <strong>Preview in new tab</strong>, and you see the post&#8217;s value for the custom field &#8220;Weather&#8221; displayed on the front end.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a video of the whole process.</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>Phew! For the first time, that seems like a complicated move. You might not want to do too often, right? Or maybe it gives you a bit more confidence. I&#8217;d be happy to help you while you try to figure it out. Just email me at <a href=\"mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com\">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a> or ping me in WP Slack as @bph.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add the block with bindings to the single post template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next and final step is easier. Now that you know how this works, you might want to add the block to the Single Post template. So every time an editor makes a logbook entry and adds the weather to the meta box, it will display on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the video of the steps.</p>\n\n\n\n		\n			<div class=\"jetpack-videopress-player__wrapper\"> <div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div></div>\n			\n			\n		\n		\n\n\n<p>From there, you can embellish the weather section of your posts some more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After I transformed the block into a column, I added another paragraph to the template section with a drop shadow.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"652\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-21-at-17.44.26.png?resize=652%2C372&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27575\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some things to consider</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it works well when you always remember to add the weather note to every post, there is no reminder, and we know there is no preview. I also see two major issues: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is no default option on what to display when the value of the custom field is empty. It will display the empty white box.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>All you can do with custom field in meta boxes is a text input field. There is no select box to make sure only a certain set of values is added, no control of numbers, etc. and shadow just. These issues and a few more are better solved with code.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In his post, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/02/20/introducing-block-bindings-part-1-connecting-custom-fields/\">Introducing Block Bindings, part 1: connecting custom fields</a>, Justin Tadlock wrote about how to user <code>register_meta()</code> function to add custom fields properly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta boxes are also a legacy system that doesn&#8217;t really fit the block editor way of doing things anymore. The Gutenberg developers are working on the interface to add and edit custom fields as well as make the block show that it&#8217;s connected to a custom field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in the Block Binding API work  you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">follow along this tracking issue.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please share in the comments if you run into trouble, and you are welcome to share your ideas and implementations if you followed along.

It features a new Product Details block style, six new layouts for the Product Collection block, and a sales column for marketing analytics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers, it offers improved logging, a notice on Legacy REST API removal, simplified customer history calculation, and 8.6.1 patching four issues. </p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>After a slight delay, <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/02/15/woocommerce-8-6-product-blocks-order-attribution-updates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce 8.6 was released</a> last week. An Order Attribution Tracking issue discovered in 8.5.2 <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/02/13/woocommerce-8-6-0-delayed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prompted the delay</a> so that a fix could be included in the 8.6 release. With 365 commits from 73 contributors, this latest version of WooCommerce introduces some slick new features and enhancements for merchants and developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"556\" height=\"206\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/block-styles-section.png\" alt=\"Product Details Block Styles Section\" class=\"wp-image-154233\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Block Style for Product Details Block</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce 8.6 introduces a new ‘Styles’ area for the Product Details block with two options; Classic and Minimal. By default the Minimal style is selected on new installs with the Classic style being maintained to ensure compatibility with theme-based CSS customizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Product Collection Block Gains Six New Layouts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably the most impactful feature for merchants and marketers is the introduction of six new layouts for the Product Collection block. Now merchants can select between New Arrivals, Top Rated, Best Selling, On Sale, Featured and Product Catalog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1506\" height=\"1240\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/product-collection-layouts.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Product Collection Layouts Interface.\" class=\"wp-image-154234\" />\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>These new layouts can be combined, mixed and matched on a single page to respond better to the needs of merchants. For example, promote your new spring arrivals in a block above your winter sale items that leads into your complete product catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sales Column Added to Marketing Page</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For merchants who are using WooCommerce to view and manage their marketing channels (i.e. Google Ad campaigns), a new column in the Sales card provides a quick look at how various campaigns are performing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Developer Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Logging System Changes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significant improvements have been made to the internal logging system in WooCommerce 8.6. Merchants and developers now have an interface for browsing and viewing log entries that will improve debugging and auditing in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a log file browser that lets users filter, sort and manage log files. Users can now click individual log files and view them right within their WordPress dashboard. Search has also been improved to enable selecting a group of files to search within, filtering, sorting and linking individual lines in files that contain the search term. Logs have also now been made fully exportable. Users can download individual files or in bulk via a zip file.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Legacy REST API Removal Notice</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WooCommerce prepares for the removal of its legacy REST API in 9.0, merchants still using the legacy API will now see a notice of the upcoming change. Given the pace of releases, this means deprecation/removal is about 4 months away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simplified Customer History Calculation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Order Attribution Tracking the main cause for the delay in releasing 8.6, a simplified customer history calculation was introduced to mitigate the risk of a calculation resulting in 500 errors (server errors) on larger shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8.6.1 Release Patches 4 Issues</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A patch was released earlier this week that fixes four issues identified with the release of 8.6. These issues were significant enough that this release was issued very quickly. Check out the details on the <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/02/20/woocommerce-8-6-1-fixes-to-issues-introduced-in-8-6-0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WooCommerce Developer blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-200-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">w00t Dev Docs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By Ronny Shani</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly before the release, the team<a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/01/31/introducing-new-woocommerce-developer-documentation/\"> launched a brand new</a> documentation website for developers. The<a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/docs/\"> Woo Developer Docs</a> embraces the docs-as-code approach, hosting markdown files in a centralized location:<a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/trunk/docs\"> the docs folder of the project’s GitHub monorepo</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is a win-win:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>It encourages community collaboration and empowers users to contribute to the documentation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It enables the plugin’s developers to update docs whenever they modify or update WooCommerce’s codebase.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/roadmap/improving-docs/\">Improving the developer experience</a> is part of Woo’s roadmap; V1 is a great example of how to do it right.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Progress On New Product Editor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, a small tweak to the new Product Editor was introduced, adding the ability to mark a product as Featured. Merchants using the new Product Editor can click an inline star icon in the title field. The new product editor is making steady progress as it reshapes the way merchants interact with WooCommerce in the product creation flow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have not yet, now is a good time to give the new Product Editor a test drive to see what’s coming and how the interface of WooCommerce is changing.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:10:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"James Giroux\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Do The Woo Community: WordCamp Asia 2024 with Andy Saw &amp; Huanyi Chuang\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://dothewoo.io/wordcamp-asia-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:377:\"<p>Volunteers from the organizing team, Andy Saw &#038; Huanyi Chuang cover all the ground for the event coming in Tapai in March.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/wordcamp-asia-2024/\">WordCamp Asia 2024 with Andy Saw &amp; Huanyi Chuang</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 09:56:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Navigating the Nexus: A Chronicle of Recent WordPress Acquisitions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154211\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://wptavern.com/navigating-the-nexus-a-chronicle-of-recent-wordpress-acquisitions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3440:\"<p>Over the past four months, some exciting developments have been bustling in the dynamic mergers and acquisitions arena of WordPress. To catch everyone up let&#8217;s grab a beverage of choice and take a stroll down the calendar of memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, on February 15th, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/optinmonster-acquires-beacon-lead-magnet-creator\">OptinMonster announced</a> its acquisition of Beacon Lead Magnet Creator. Per the press release from OptinMonster &#8220;Beacon makes it easy for anyone to create and deliver professional lead magnets, without needing a writer, graphic designer or developer.&#8221; This move adds another layer to OptinMonster&#8217;s robust toolkit, reinforcing its position as a go-to resource for businesses seeking to optimize their lead-generation strategies. Additionally, the founders of <a href=\"https://beacon.by/\">Beacon.by</a>, brothers Kevin &amp; Eion McGrath will be moving on to other ventures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stepping back two weeks lands us on the date of January 28th when Andrew Wilder at <a href=\"http://nerdpress.net\">NerdPress.net</a> shared the news that they acquired the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rvg-optimize-database/\">Optimize Database After Deleting Revisions Plugin</a>. As Andrew states. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tool we&#8217;ve long relied on &#8212; installing it on all our clients&#8217; sites&#8230;.and less than a day after releasing our first update (patching minor security vulnerabilities), the plugin has already been downloaded nearly 23,000 times&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolling back the calendar yet another seven weeks we see the calendar shows the date of December 6, 2023, and we once again hear from Andrew Wilder of NerdPress.net. This time the news is a bit more celebratory as it&#8217;s about their first acquisition ever! They acquired the social media sharing plugin <a href=\"https://www.nerdpress.net/announcing-hubbub/\">Grow Social from Mediavine</a>. Part of the agreement in the acquisition was to rename the plugin to clear up any confusion between Mediavines properties &#8220;Grow Social&#8221; and &#8220;Grow&#8221;, which they have by rebranding the plugin <a href=\"https://morehubbub.com/\">Hubbub</a>.

For each of these to be possible, the person or organization on the other side must be sure that this identity is legit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than <a href=\"https://www.javelinstrategy.com/2022-Identity-fraud-scams-report\">42 million folks reporting to have been victims of identity fraud just in 2021</a> and just in the USA, everyone must be highly vigilant regarding their digital information. This guide covers why digital identity verification is necessary and the various methods you can use to enable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also get familiar with a standout solution in digital identity management – <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>. Our platform simplifies digital identity verification and facilitates more seamless integration for developers creating websites, web apps, or digital stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s jump right into it!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is digital identity verification?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, this is the process of <strong>authenticating users to confirm their identity is legitimate</strong>, preventing fraud attempts and elevating cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves collecting various <em>types </em>of user data – from personal information like name and date of birth to biometric data such as fingerprints or facial patterns. This data is then carefully analyzed, creating a digital identity that the system uses to assess whether the user is genuinely who they claim to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sectors such as cybersecurity, online banking, and eCommerce, digital identity verification is essential. Online banking, for instance, can prevent unauthorized access to private accounts, avoiding substantial financial losses. Similarly, in ecommerce, verifying customer identities can deter fraudulent transactions, leading to a safer shopping environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital fraud has serious real-life consequences. In 2022 alone, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/11020/online-fraud-in-the-united-states/#topicOverview\">cybercrime accounted for monetary losses, amassing an astounding 10.3 billion U.S. dollars</a>, making it evident just how critical digital identity verification is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, with advanced technological strategies, such as multi-factor authentication and AI-powered checks, and by following regulatory mandates such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), you can effectively keep cybercriminals at bay and create a secure digital environment where users can interact fearlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Compliance with Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering regulations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>KYC guidelines require financial businesses to corroborate the identity and suitability of every customer while continuously monitoring their transactions for suspicious activities. Similarly, AML regulations are comprehensive policies designed to combat illicit actions like money laundering or terror financing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can probably guess, to comply with these regulations, you need to apply different digital identity verification methods; for example – Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided digital identity verification. Advanced algorithms can quickly detect anomalies in user profiles, enabling faster, more accurate determination of a user&#8217;s identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Website security</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing a solid verification process can protect many different website elements from unauthorized access and potential data theft, including user login interfaces, transactional pages, and backend data storage facilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a secure verification process, websites become easy targets for cybercriminals and are exposed to threats with potentially catastrophic outcomes – from loss of sensitive user information, identity theft, and damaging brand reputation to great financial losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, this can be easily prevented by implementing robust digital identity verification methods and ensuring that all employees and partners know the security protocols. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of automated identity verification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated identity verification is a technology-based process that uses algorithms and data analysis to confirm an individual&#8217;s identity without human intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at how it can benefit identity verification procedures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decrease in human errors: </strong>Typically, manual identity checks are prone to oversights, inconsistencies, and delays. Automated verification eliminates these drawbacks by employing superior algorithms and databases that enhance accuracy and reliability. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved efficiency: </strong>Automation speeds up identity checks, making it faster for users. For instance, if someone wants to make a big online transaction, automated identity checks would greatly reduce the time it takes to verify whether the customer is legitimate, allowing them to proceed with the transaction while providing a hassle-free experience. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Convenience: </strong>With automated identification, there is no need to go through mountains of documentation or force the customer to be physically present to seal the deal. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased security provisions: </strong>Modern-day systems incorporate a range of sophisticated technologies, including AI and biometrics, adding multiple layers of security. For instance, AI algorithms are designed to adapt and evolve to potential threats, while biometric checks like fingerprint or facial recognition provide an endless series of verifications, preventing nearly all attempts at identity spoofing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common methods for digital identity verification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <strong>six primary techniques for digital authentication</strong> that can be combined or used separately:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ID document verification</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-4-edited.png\" alt=\"A diagram showing that OCR can transcribe images, PDFs, and docs into text.\" class=\"wp-image-1157\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Identity Document Verification is used to verify the authenticity of government-issued identification documents such as passports, driver&#8217;s licenses, or voter ID cards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract data from a document&#8217;s text fields. This data is then analyzed and verified against numerous databases and real-time information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use many tools for ID Document Verification, such as <a href=\"https://ekata.com/\">Ekata</a>, <a href=\"https://onfido.com/use-cases/identity-verification/\">Onfido</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.jumio.com/\">Jumio</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biometric verification</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-5-edited.png\" alt=\"Facial and fingerprint recognition.\" class=\"wp-image-1159\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This method gives businesses a very high level of security as it focuses on fingerprint recognition, iris or retina scanning, and face recognition. It uses the unique biological traits of an individual that are hard to forge or steal instead of relying on what a user knows (like a password) or what a user has (like an ID card) for identification. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a> have implemented face and fingerprint recognition techniques for user identification. Their cultivated databases have proven to be instrumental in enhancing user access management, proving crucial in fields beyond consumer electronics like border control and banking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security aside, privacy considerations around biometric data must be addressed keenly with robust data-protection frameworks to prevent misuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Liveness detection</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-6-edited.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1161\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Liveness detection is an integral component of the digital identity verification landscape. It refers to the technology that authenticates whether the user engaging with a service or application is indeed a ‘live’ human and not a spam bot or an impersonator, significantly fortifying cybersecurity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology relies on evaluating user interactions for signs of natural human behavior such as eye movement, facial expression changes, and depth perception – traits that bots find challenging to mimic. For example, platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.id.me/\">ID.me</a> and Jumio use methods like optical-based motion analysis to accurately detect living entities and mitigate identity fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-7-edited.png\" alt=\"A form asking, \'What is your childhood pet\'s name?\'\" class=\"wp-image-1163\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge-based Authentication (KBA) is an identity verification process that uses private information unique to the user for authentication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes in two forms:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static KBA:</strong> Uses pre-set questions like &#8220;What is your mother&#8217;s maiden name?&#8221;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dynamic KBA: </strong>Revolves around public information, with questions such as &#8220;Which one of these addresses are associated with you?&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, KBA has its vulnerabilities, such as people often choosing very predictable questions and answers. So, it’s no wonder the cybersecurity industry is gradually tilting towards safer alternatives. Biometric authentication and multi-factor authentication are growing trends, offering a more secure way of verifying digital identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is rel=me?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\">rel=&#8221;me&#8221; attribute</a> is a way to <strong>indicate that two different web pages are owned or controlled by the same person or entity</strong>. This can be useful for search engines and other services that try to understand the connections between different parts of your online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you have a professional blog and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter (now X)</a> account. To link these two and establish your authority over both, you can use the following code on your website and affirm ownership of both profiles in the digital space.</p>\n\n\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td>&lt;<strong>a</strong> href=&#8221;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/yourTwitterHandle&#8221\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/yourTwitterHandle&#038;#8221</a>; rel=&#8221;me&#8221;&gt;Follow me <strong>on</strong> <strong>Twitter</strong>&lt;/<strong>a</strong>&gt;</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, for example, leverages rel=me to authenticate <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/\">Mastodon</a> accounts, providing credible proof for the influential role of this tag in elevating the digital identity verification process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Identity providers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity Providers (IdPs) are trustworthy platforms that authenticate the identity of a user. After confirming the identity, IdPs grant authorization credentials, such as tokens or digital certificates, enabling users to access a website or application without creating unique logins for every site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite simplifying processes massively, IdPs do not compromise security. They adhere to rigorous security standards like <a href=\"https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/\">OpenID Connect</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/what-is-saml/\">Security Assertion Markup Language</a> (SAML) to guarantee protection from unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gravatar: The digital identity verification provider you need</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Verifying the identity of users who sign up to a website/web store/web app can be a complicated task, but you can make this much easier with a trusted provider such as <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar simplifies the process of digital identity verification by assigning globally recognized avatars. These avatars are linked to users&#8217; email addresses, authored posts, comments, and more, reinforcing a robust and unique digital identifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, a user is verified when they prove they own the particular service’s login credentials, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stackoverflow</a>, and many more. The moment an account is added to a profile, it is deemed “verified” and, thereby, securely validated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar profiles are implemented across many platforms, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, making every digital journey a consistent and streamlined experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This digital verification system stands out with many impressive features, such as:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy-forward approach: </strong>The complete control over personal data remains with the user. They decide what&#8217;s public and what&#8217;s private, catering to the needs of privacy-conscious netizens.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Easy integration: </strong>Integrate with Gravatar in just a few minutes using the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/general/hash/\">developer API</a>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimized customer experience:</strong> For instance, new users registering on a blog site would find their Gravatar avatar automatically displayed instead of an impersonal placeholder. This can significantly reduce the number of steps in the profile setup and make the sign-up process quicker and smoother.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Be it enriching user experiences, simplifying the digital identity verification process, or ensuring avatar consistency, Gravatar proves to be an indispensable tool.

This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As an open-source software whose mission is to democratize publishing, WordPress adopted a set of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/accessibility/\">Accessibility Coding Standards</a>. These apply to the project’s core and official plugins, complemented by its long-term goal of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/accessibility/\">achieving Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 compliance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To deliver on this promise, version 6.5 ships with over 65 accessibility improvements, including “fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design and Customization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since you can never have too much of a good thing, 6.5 comes packed with design, UI, and UX:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Background images in Group blocks get <code>backgroundSize</code> and <code>backgroundRepeat</code>&nbsp; support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Cover block gets <code>aspectRatio</code> support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Column, Columns, Image, and Button blocks get box-shadow support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rename blocks in List View.

An obvious segue into one of the most transformative features of 6.5: the Block Bindings API.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Block Bindings API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic’s Mario Santos <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">described the goal</a> of the new API:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;<em>This API aims to connect block attributes to values, obtained from different sources, that might vary depending on the context. For example, a value like post_author that changes depending on the current post.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This will expand the capabilities of existing blocks […] For example, having a Heading block with the content of the Post Author without needing a new Post Author block.</em>&#8220;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The API already powers the Synced Patterns and the much-anticipated ability to connect custom fields to block attributes. The list of supported blocks and attributes is short, but that’s only the beginning:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paragraph:</strong> content</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heading:</strong> content</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Image:</strong> URL, alt, title</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Button: </strong>text, URL, linkTarget, rel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom fields have been neglected in the Block Editor, hidden behind the Preferences window like a lost treasure. Let’s hope this is the first sign of their comeback. If you’re interested in what you can build with this powerful combo, <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/02/20/introducing-block-bindings-part-1-connecting-custom-fields/\">check out Justin Tadlock’s tutorial</a> on the WordPress Developer Blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next on the <em>finally</em> list is the Font Library, aka the WordPress font manager.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, you won’t need to write any code or install any plugins—from now on, you can do it yourself, regardless of your active theme. The fonts are stored under /wp-content/fonts which makes it as theme-agnostic as the Media Library.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1500\" height=\"991\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Font-Library.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the new Font Library (WP 6.5 Beta 2)\" class=\"wp-image-154203\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To access the Library, open the Styles sidebar, click on Typography, and click the icon next to FONTS. Try to upload, install from Google Fonts, activate, and, well, manage your fonts. Once installed, use it across the Editor, wherever the blocks’ Typography attribute is enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers can access the Font Library programmatically, create custom Font Collections for their users, or disable it altogether. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54477\">Take a peak at the still-WIP documentation</a> for instructions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The grand finale of this impressive lineup is the Interactivity API. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interactivity-api-prepares-for-its-official-debut-in-wordpress-6-5\">James Giroux covered it here on the Tavern</a> earlier this week, so we’ll only give you a taste of <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">WP Movies Demo</a>:</p>\n\n\n\nA walkthrough of <strong>WP Movies</strong>, a demo project that features the Interactivity API (<a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wp-movies-demo\">Source</a>)\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a developer interested in the nitty-gritty details and want to try what’s already possible, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wp-movies-demo\">WP Movies GitHub repository</a>, where you’ll find a getting started tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-tavern-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>That Playground link is tempting, so go experiment, and then come back to tell us which feature you’re most excited about.

Finally, we’ll see how <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet’s top&#8209;rated AI&#8209;driven anti&#8209;spam solution</a> is successfully leading the charge of blocking spambots on the&nbsp;internet.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283763\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a&nbsp;spambot?</h2>\n\n<p>A spambot is a computerized program that repetitively sends spam throughout the internet. It is often used to post irrelevant messages in places where people interact with one another, including comment sections of websites, social media messaging platforms, or online discussion&nbsp;forums.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do spambots&nbsp;work?</h2>\n\n<p>Most spambots begin their nefarious activity by automatically setting up fake accounts on social media, email hosts, or forums, which typically only require basic information such as a name and email&nbsp;address.</p>\n\n<p>Once spambots gain access to their target websites, they can begin posting spam messages based on a specific set of rules. Email spambots might scan, scrape, and save email addresses or phone numbers on the web to fuel future spam&nbsp;activities.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1082\" height=\"396\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-7.png\" alt=\"example of a spam comment on a website4\" class=\"wp-image-283765\" />\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are common types of spam caused by&nbsp;spambots?</h2>\n\n<p>Spambots can be extremely agile and used in a wide variety of places on a website. Here are a few of the most common ways you might encounter&nbsp;spambots:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Contact form spam</strong>. spambots can be programmed to automatically fill out contact forms online. This allows them to gain access to a particular website or admin who receives the form submissions. Sophisticated bots may be able to implement SQL injection attacks as&nbsp;well.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Comment spam</strong>. Many websites offer comment sections where users can post questions, share ideas, or express opinions. spambots may automatically insert a spam comment in these areas, advertising unwanted products or services or tempting users to interact with them. The malicious actors can then cause those users to fall for scams or insert malware onto their&nbsp;devices.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fake account registrations.</strong> Imposter accounts can be automatically generated, especially if websites ask for only a few basic pieces of information like a name and email address. These accounts allow spambots to gain access to websites for future spamming activities such as posting negative reviews or wasting the time of a sales team focused on non&#8209;existent&nbsp;customers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Forum spam</strong>. Online forums are great places for people to discuss just about anything they are interested in. spambots pollute these spaces by posting unrelated information among legitimate comments and discussions. Forums that allow anonymous posting can be especially&nbsp;vulnerable.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Email spam</strong>. Gaining access to a large number of email addresses can fuel spam activity. Some spambots can scrape the web, access email lists, and save them to a database, which can then be used by cybercriminals to spread malware, run phishing attacks, or set up future&nbsp;scams.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Doxxing</strong>. Doxxing occurs when spambots maliciously publish private information on a public forum. This may include publishing financial details or posting private data that could put people in potential physical&nbsp;harm.</li></ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the motivations behind&nbsp;spambots?</h2>\n\n<p>Do you ever wonder why cybercriminals spend time creating spambots and what their ultimate purpose could be? The motivations behind spambots are varied and numerous. Here are a few of the most popular reasons for creating&nbsp;spambots:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>SEO manipulation</strong>. Some spambots attempt to trick Google’s algorithms into believing that a particular website deserves top ranking by adding backlinks from other&nbsp;sites</li>\n\n<li><strong>Phishing</strong>. Other spambots work to promote phishing scams, hoping that users will give up key account information such as passwords or usernames. These spambots may attempt to gain access to credit card or other financial information.&nbsp;</li>\n\n<li><strong>Malware distribution</strong>. spambots may also be used to distribute malware through the continued sharing of tempting links in comment threads.&nbsp;</li>\n\n<li><strong>Social media manipulation. </strong>Like trying to trick Google Analytics, spambots may be used to manipulate social media activity as well. Spam comments or posts may attempt to sway public opinion or create an illusion that something is more widespread and popular than it actually&nbsp;is.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Advertising and promotion</strong>. Finally, spambots may be used to promote products and services, adult content, or too&#8209;good&#8209;to&#8209;be&#8209;true offers in an attempt to attract user&nbsp;interaction.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1260\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-8.png\" alt=\"spam comment that\'s unrelated to the post\" class=\"wp-image-283766\" />\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are common signs of spambot&nbsp;activity?</h2>\n\n<p>In order to stop spambot activity, it’s important to understand common signs before unwanted posting gets out of hand and your user base is inundated with unwanted email or spam messages. Here are things to look&nbsp;for:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>A sudden surge in traffic</strong>. From a system perspective, if your IT department suddenly notes a rapid surge in traffic on your website, you may be a target for spambot&nbsp;activity.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>High bounce rates with short session durations</strong>. If you happen to see higher than normal bounce rates with very short session times, you may have spambots visiting your&nbsp;site.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Inconsistent or patterned user behavior</strong>. spambots that are posting on website forums or in comment sections will display inconsistent and nonsensical user behavior. They won’t respond appropriately to other&nbsp;posts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Irrelevance</strong>. In most cases, spambots will post irrelevant advertisements, comments or questions in public forums that don’t follow the existing conversation. If they’re programmed to respond to others, the language used may also seem out of&nbsp;place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Activity from known malicious IP lists</strong>. If you keep a list of malicious IP addresses as part of your cybersecurity practices, you may be able to flag anything from the same IP address as potential spambot&nbsp;activities.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Excessive errors</strong>. Many spambot messages contain a great deal of errors in terms of grammar or spelling. They may not even make sense at&nbsp;all.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Ridiculous deals</strong>. If a product or service is advertised at prices that sound way too good to be true, they probably exist only to draw clicks to a malicious site or activate malware or phishing&nbsp;attempts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Pushing users to click or forward</strong>. spambots designed to spread malware or facilitate phishing attempts need users to click on links or forward them to others on their contact list. Urgent requests to do so should be a red flag for spambot&nbsp;activity.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Unknown respondents</strong>. If activity is coming from individuals who seem suspicious, in combination with any of these other clues, you may be dealing with spambot&nbsp;activity.</li></ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the implications of not blocking&nbsp;spambots?</h2>\n\n\n<p>For a busy website manager or IT department, it can be tempting to ignore spambot activity, at least for the time being if other technical issues are pressing. spambot activity may be seen as merely annoying, but not as dangerous as other cybercriminal activity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>However, not blocking spambots can have far&#8209;reaching consequences for your overall business. Here are a few to&nbsp;consider:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>A bad user experience</strong>. First and foremost, spambots can contribute to a negative user experience. If you are trying to encourage discussion, comments, and questions on a public forum, having random spambot postings throughout can be irritating and annoying to those trying to truly interact with one&nbsp;another.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>A tarnished site reputation</strong>. Not only can you develop a poor site reputation if spambot activity is regularly associated with your website, but some spambot activity may include posting fake negative reviews or the generation of false complaints, which can have negative implications for your business as a&nbsp;whole.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The risk of penalties from search engines. </strong>Search engine algorithms are constantly being developed to deal with spambots and false optimization attempts. Your site could be penalized for carrying irrelevant links to other sites if they violate search engine&nbsp;rules.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The risk of site blocklisting</strong>. If dangerous spam becomes a rampant problem on your site, search engines and web browsers may actually blocklist your site or display warnings to potential visitors. This could eliminate the majority of your site traffic in a matter of&nbsp;days.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Reduced site performance</strong>. It takes time and server resources to process spambot activity. This may slow down the performance of your site for legitimate&nbsp;users.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Increased server costs</strong>. Some server hosting companies charge based on the resources used. Unwanted spambot activity may increase these&nbsp;costs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>A waste of time and money</strong>. If spambots operate by generating fake inquiries, your business could waste valuable sales force time trying to follow up or sort through junk leads to get to actual&nbsp;prospects.</li></ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to stop&nbsp;spambots</h2>\n\n<p>The good news is that there are several tools and solutions to help you stop spambots effectively. Each has advantages and disadvantages, but all of them can help you eliminate unwanted posts, email scraping, and fake account&nbsp;set&#8209;ups.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-9.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage\" class=\"wp-image-283767\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 AI&#8209;powered anti&#8209;spam&nbsp;solution</h3>\n\n<p>The top choice to stop spambots is <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet</a>, which is an AI&#8209;powered anti&#8209;spam solution used by more than 100 million websites today. It uses machine learning technology to identify and get rid of 99.99 percent of all&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;Akismet?</h4>\n\n<p>Akismet is a powerful anti&#8209;spam solution built on cutting edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. It has been blocking spam for nearly two decades, and its technology is continuously learning to stay ahead every step of the way. It’s successfully removed more than 500 billion pieces of spam across more than 100 million&nbsp;sites.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does Akismet&nbsp;work?</h4>\n\n\n<p>Unlike some other spam blockers, Akismet works completely in the background, so your users experience zero friction on your site. They simply navigate to the areas, discussion boards, and contact forms they want and proceed without so much as a CAPTCHA or box to click.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>However, spambots are detected with near&#8209;perfect accuracy and are booted from the site or prevented from submitting forms. Depending on your settings, Akismet can even toss comments directly in the trash without you ever having to see&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"860\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-10.png\" alt=\"spam settings in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-283768\" />\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the benefits of using&nbsp;Akismet?</h4>\n\n<p>Sites that rely on Akismet reap many benefits. First, since Akismet works in the background without relying on your users to “prove” that they’re not spambots, the user experience is far superior to other prevention methods like CAPTCHA. A faster, less annoying user experience often results in better conversion rates and higher overall visitor&nbsp;satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n<p>Second, since Akismet’s technology learns from every spam it’s removed from more than 100 million websites, you benefit from all this knowledge. Just about everything that’s known about spam is stored in a cloud-based database, ready to inform Askimet’s actions for your specific site. This learning will continue over time, keeping your site nearly free of all new spam —&nbsp;even new spam techniques that have yet to come!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Third, because the database is stored in the cloud, you get the benefits of Akismet without any negative effects on speed or storage for your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<p>Want to know how it works in real life?

In this case study, ConvertKit executives walk through their spam challenges, potential negative effects spam has on their business and the entrepreneurs they support, and how Akismet is helping them solve their spambot&nbsp;problem.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-11.png\" alt=\"stats about ConvertKit, using Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-283769\" />\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to get started with&nbsp;Akismet</h4>\n\n\n<p>If you’re ready to eliminate spam without frustrating visitors, you can download <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> today. On another platform? Developing a unique app? Learn about the<a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/\"> flexible Akismet API</a> to integrate it with your project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"699\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-12.png\" alt=\"Akismet in the WordPress plugin library\" class=\"wp-image-283770\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Enterprise companies can <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">reach out to the Akismet team</a> to get a custom solution just for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Honeypots and&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h3>\n\n<p>Two other common ways that companies can stop spambots are honeypots and CAPTCHA&nbsp;puzzles.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-a-honeypot/\">Honeypots</a> are set up like a trap, attempting to lure spambots to complete an invisible, unneeded field so that spam can be quickly identified. While real users do not see the invisible field, spambots are automatically scanning code for fields to complete and fall for the honeypot&nbsp;trap.</p>\n\n<p>Although honeypots are effective at blocking spambots targeting form completion, they do not effectively stop email scraping or other types of spambot&nbsp;activity.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1262\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-13.png\" alt=\"example of a reCAPTCHA\" class=\"wp-image-283771\" />\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">reCAPTCHA puzzles</a> are familiar to nearly everyone, requiring that the user check certain boxes that contain specific images to prove that they’re human or complete other types of puzzles. CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA puzzles are often frustrating because images can be difficult to decipher or even understand across&nbsp;cultures.</p>\n\n<p>Although a wide variety of other CAPTCHA alternatives have been developed in an effort to address these issues, they all still require user interaction and can be impossible to complete for those with various&nbsp;impairments.</p>\n\n<p>Since CAPTCHAs are often needed at key points in the customer journey — such as requesting a sales call or checkout points — they can create a negative user experience and significantly diminish conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Web application firewalls&nbsp;(WAFs)</h3>\n\n<p>Traditional web application firewalls (WAFs) were created to guard against things like SQL injections, cross&#8209;site scripting, and session hijacking. However, they often fail to keep up with the evolution of bad actors, including those using&nbsp;spambots.</p>\n\n<p>While next&#8209;generation firewalls (NGFW) tried to make headway in detecting new applications, they still use basic methods like simply blocking repetitive inquiries, identifying browsers, or blocking specific IP addresses. Many improvements rely on filters to identify malicious activity but are only somewhat effective at blocking threats. As bots advance, these NGFW also have trouble keeping up with more sophisticated&nbsp;activities.</p>\n\n\n<p>In addition, businesses often struggle with managing WAF policies that can be operationally complex, leaving patches undone and resulting in an increased number of vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">IP blocking</h3>\n\n\n<p>Another proven method of stopping spambots is traditional IP blocking. Many IT departments have a list of IP addresses that have generated a great deal of malicious or spam activity in the past and can automatically block any traffic coming from those particular IP&nbsp;addresses.</p>\n\n<p>Although generally effective, this approach does not prevent more sophisticated spambot activity and could potentially block activity from a legitimate source. It’s limited in overall effectiveness and more manual to set up and&nbsp;manage.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Confirmed opt&#8209;in (COI) or double opt&#8209;in&nbsp;(DOI)</h3>\n\n<p>Businesses can also use a confirmed opt&#8209;in or a double opt&#8209;in approach to stop spambots that are trying to sign up with fake email addresses. This process requires that new contacts be verified, requiring them to click on a link in an email sent immediately after they submit a&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1420\" height=\"972\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-14.png\" alt=\"MailPoet email sign-up confirmation\" class=\"wp-image-283772\" />\n\n\n<p>Although this process can be somewhat effective, screening out fake sign&#8209;ups, it only addresses spambots that are setting up false accounts. Other malicious system activity or sophisticated spambots may go&nbsp;undetected.</p>\n\n\n<p>In addition, the DOI process means extending the sign-up process. The more you require of prospects, the more likely some of them will abandon the sign-up process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>In addition, the younger generation often doesn’t check email as frequently as older generations, which causes a bottleneck in your engagement or purchase process. Finally, some users may not confirm and therefore slip through the cracks for future marketing&nbsp;outreach.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multifactor authentication</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A wide number of businesses now use multifactor authentication to provide an extra layer of security on their sites. This usually involves a user confirming their identity through more than one method, such as an email account or phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"976\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-15.png\" alt=\"setting up two-factor authentication with WordPress.com\" class=\"wp-image-283773\" />\n\n\n<p>Although this can be very effective at ensuring that users are legitimate customers or prospects, it again adds another step in user engagement, potentially causing additional friction that can cause lost leads or abandonment of a checkout&nbsp;process.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: Leading the charge in blocking&nbsp;spambots</h2>\n\n<p>While many solutions exist to help businesses block spambot activity, it’s clear that the number one choice is <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet</a>. Its years of experience with blocking spam, coupled with powerful artificial intelligence and machine learning technology, make it the clear choice for a comprehensive, effective spambot blocking&nbsp;solution.</p>\n\n<p>More than 100 million websites agree, taking advantage of the cumulative knowledge that Akismet has gathered since 2005. With 99.99 percent effectiveness and an impressive track record of removing more than 500 billion pieces of spam from the internet, it’s hard to argue about the solution’s&nbsp;success.</p>\n\n<p>Most importantly, Akismet completes its job unbeknownst to your users and visitors. Prospects and customers can journey smoothly through your sales funnel without stopping to complete CAPTCHA puzzles or double opt&#8209;in confirmations at inopportune times. This means a smoother engagement process and less friction, leading to happier users and a better&nbsp;reputation.</p>\n\n\n<p>With its advanced technology and comprehensive spam database residing in the cloud, Akismet doesn’t affect processing time, server activity, or loading speeds. This ensures that your site continues to operate quickly and effectively without diverting resources to spambot detection and removal activities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Finally, Akismet will continue learning into the future, which means that, even if spambot creators get more sophisticated, Akismet will be ready with a spambot blocking&nbsp;solution.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/talk-to-sales/\">Get started with Akismet.</a>&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Feb 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Do The Woo Community: WordPress and WooCommerce at CloudFest 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79129\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://dothewoo.io/wordpress-and-woocommerce-at-cloudfest-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:396:\"<p>Hosts Tammie and Jonathan talk about WP Day at CloudFest this year and the increased visibility of WordPress and Woo at the event.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

Back in November, the Tavern’s last standing writer, Sarah Gooding joined her predecessors Jeff Chandler and Justin Tadlock in announcing her departure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg later put the call out for those interested in becoming full-time writers. Hundreds applied and from that list, earlier this February, seven were chosen to participate in a public trial.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><s>Each travelled by train to a meeting where they were introduced to each other and then dropped into the middle of an arena with the only rule being to survive.</s></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may feel a bit like the Hunger Games have come to WordPress. But, behind the scenes, it&#8217;s a ton of enthusiasm and collaboration. After all, it&#8217;s for a platform and community we are all passionate about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hitting publish is stressful (at least for me), but, we’re excited about this chance. We&#8217;re eager to bring our unique views to Tavern readers and the wider WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each person in the trial has two weeks with full access to the Tavern to create content. The trial contributors have not been given any restrictions on how much content they can contribute, the format of that content, or the subject matter of the content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the Hunger Games, we’re each other’s biggest fans and supporters as we go through this process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The availability of trial contributors varies so for about a month, each of the seven will have staggered start dates. You’ll see content from each appear over time as they begin their trials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>So what’s it like day-to-day to run the Tavern?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s everything you would imagine an industry journal would have. We’re collaborating in a private Slack channel, sharing ideas and figuring out how to create the content we’re passionate about. Early on the crew self-organized around a content calendar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re sharing article drafts for feedback from each other. Giving way to each other when we have similar ideas for articles. Challenging ideas and pushing each other to be better. All to create the best experience for Tavern readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re still figuring things out. For example, we need to find the right images to use. We also need to reconnect the X/Twitter account so articles are broadcast from it. And, we need to clean up comments on existing articles. The day-to-day things that keep the Tavern humming along.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>We’re keen to engage with Tavern readers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts on what we’re creating. All of us are in the Make WordPress Slack so feel free to ping us with your thoughts and feedback.

These figures represent a steady rise in the adoption of the Block editor. However, this year, 12.3% of respondents chose the <em>Other</em> category (likely referring to site builders).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>As to their <strong>satisfaction</strong> with the Site Editor, 45.1% said it meets their needs for building websites.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>51.7% built websites for others, and 41.9% created a plugin, theme, style variation, or a block pattern.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some activities that saw a significant increase include consuming <strong>learning</strong> materials on<a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\"> learn.wordpress.org</a> and various types of <strong>contributions</strong> and involvement with the community: participated in a meetup/WordCamp, contributed to the platform, and joined the Making WordPress Slack.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Seeing as most responders develop, design, or maintain WordPress websites, it’s good to see that 61.1% say they are <strong>familiar</strong> with Block-based themes and plugins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63.3% think <em>WordPress is as good as, or better than, other site builders and CMSs</em>, down from 68% in 2022. Interestingly, many also regularly use <strong>other</strong> blogging and newsletter tools to publish content, mainly Medium, Tumblr, and Blogger. The top reasons respondents preferred WordPress were open-source, familiarity, maturity, and cost.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The figures above correspond with answers to the question, <em>What&#8217;s the best thing about WordPress?</em>  where <strong>performance, scalability, and accessibility</strong> registered a huge spike while parameters like ease of use, flexibility, cost, and block themes dropped significantly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ranking “essential plugins” out of the 20 most popular ones provides a glimpse into day-to-day use: Yoast SEO, Classic Editor, and WooCommerce were the top three, with <em>None of the above</em> coming fifth, Elementor Website Builder coming at 8th, and two plugins that enable post and page <strong>duplication</strong> closing the list. Gutenberg is absent.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On the other hand, too many plugins were the primary cause of <strong>frustration</strong> (133% rise from 2022, with too many themes seeing a 72% rise), followed by dissatisfactory site editing, designing, configuring, and publishing experience. The cost complaints, meanwhile, are directed at <strong>hosting</strong> companies: 7% in 2023 vs. 3% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>57.5% see phases 3 and 4 of the WordPress roadmap as beneficial for developers, creators, and publishers alike, with the rest either neutral or disagreeing.

Russian developer Maxim Dounin has made waves by announcing a new fork of the Nginx web server and caching proxy. The new fork is called <a href=\"https://freenginx.org/\"><strong>freenginx</strong></a>. This move is strategically aimed at steering clear of the corporate control wielded by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F5,_Inc.\">F5</a>, the current owner of Ngnix.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading is-style-default\"><strong>What is Nginx</strong>?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us who aren’t overly technical, Nginx is known for its versatility, serves as a robust web server, a reverse proxy, and offers formidable security features. It offers a broad range of applications which has made it a favorite among developers and IT professionals. The decision to fork Nginx comes as a response to concerns about corporate influence and the desire to maintain the open-source ethos that has been pivotal to its success.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What role does Nginx play in WordPress hosting</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that approximately<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ws-nginx\"> 34.1% of websites</a> rely on Nginx servers, this fork has potential repercussions, especially in the enterprise space and for those involved in hosting reselling. The future landscape of Nginx will undoubtedly be closely monitored, as the developments in this space could have a cascading impact on the digital infrastructure that supports a significant portion of the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What&#8217;s next?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In speaking with some of my contacts at a variety of WordPress hosting companies, the overall sentiment was both a wait-and-see approach along with some light concern and trepidation. One contact responded with, “If the fork takes and diverges it could make Nginx support a little harder.” Another added, “It will be interesting to see what happens and how the licensing changes. I suspect a lot of commercial hosts are on the commercial version but even that could be shaken up a bit, in the long term, with this Nginx [version] has been so steady for so long though that any change will raise eyebrows.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course there is the big looming question: How might this shake things up for commercial hosts in the long run? With the usual uncertainty that comes with change, hosting providers, developers, and businesses are keeping a close eye on the outcome.&nbsp; For those working in the web hosting industry, only time will tell to see what happens with this fork in the road.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Feb 2024 21:05:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Adam Silver\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Interactivity API Prepares for its Official Debut in WordPress 6.5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154092\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/interactivity-api-prepares-for-its-official-debut-in-wordpress-6-5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7100:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-4 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">tl;dr</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactivity API is merging into WordPress 6.5. It revolutionizes site interactivity by standardizing the development of interactive elements. This makes it easier for developers and enhances user experiences. It enables dynamic interactions like shared data across blocks without reloading pages. This opens up new possibilities for developers, users and businesses alike. It could mark a significant milestone in WordPress&#8217;s evolution.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Today WordPress contributor Carlos Bravo <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/19/merge-announcement-interactivity-api/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">officially announced</a> the merge of the Interactivity API into Core for WordPress 6.5. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Introduced last year</a>, the team behind the Interactivity API has been releasing builds through the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/categories/interactivity-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gutenberg plugin</a> in preparation for this pivotal moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the Interactivity API?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the challenges with interactivity in WordPress right now is that there is no set standard in how developers can approach it. Today, developers pick their tools. They define their approach to integrating with WordPress. They decide on inter-block communication. And, they make choices (and compromises) around frontend performance for every new project they deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactivity API aims to solve these problems. It provides developers with an opinionated approach that standardizes building interactive elements. The hope is that this will make it easier to focus on <em>what</em> to build and not <em>how</em> to build it.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1084\" height=\"2048\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/standard-graph-1084x2048-1.png\" alt=\"Visual representation of the decision areas covered by the Interactivity API, for developers.\" class=\"wp-image-154093\" />From the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\">original proposal </a>post on Make WordPress Core..\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does this mean for users?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind the Interactivity API use a movie website in their demo where they showcase some of the functionality that users may soon be able to enjoy. In particular is the way that multiple blocks can work together to share data. In the demo, clicking a heart button on movies in a list makes a heart counter go up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this is done instantly. It doesn&#8217;t reload the page and no developer or engineering team needs to dive deeply into layers of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine building a recipe website. You want a site visitor to build their shopping list with price estimates in their local currency. The Interactivity API would facilitate being able to create all of the dynamic elements using the Block Editor. It lets a list grow and the total cost change as a visitor adds and removes ingredients from their shopping list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the implications for developers?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the code layer of the API, let’s take the shopping list example a step further. Let&#8217;s say the blocks needed to build it have been created by three different developers. The Interactivity API has standardized the way that blocks load and communicate with each other. It creates a consistent, performant user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original proposal calls this composability and compatibility. It mentions a future state where interactive blocks can be combined and even nested in structures with defined behaviors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users have a knack for making code do what they want. Not what it was intended for, ask any QA tester right after a launch. In the future, interactive blocks will work together. They won&#8217;t be limited by their original developer. Users will be able to create patterns and interactions that go beyond their original purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactivity API and how it uses WordPress could be a pivotal moment in the Project&#8217;s history. It could create a new way of working with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the concept of single-page applications (SPAs). Today SPAs are often complex, expensive and inaccessible to most users. The Interactivity API, once more developed, could lead to a whole new kind of application category built with WordPress. How exciting would it be to unlock these types of patterns for everyday users?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the implications for WordPress businesses?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyday users will see the most impact from the Interactivity API. As blocks become more interoperable, the kinds of interactions that users can access will grow. Consequently, demand for more feature-rich or complex interactions may also grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactions API could unlock a whole new product category to monetize. It could lead to new partnerships as product businesses migrate their interactions to the block level. Think of the enterprise user who may be able to work with a suite of approved blocks. They could build performant, secure, and reliable applications in the stack and user interface they already know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is likely only scratching the surface of what could be possible. But it is clear that for WordPress to continue to outpace its rivals, innovations like the Interactivity API will need to continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-5 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Author’s Note</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not a developer so while I’ve tried my best to capture and communicate the Interactivity API and its implications, I could be wrong. If that’s the case, let me know in the comments and I’ll make the corrections. Also worth a listen is the latest <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/02/episode-73-inside-the-interactivity-api/\">WordPress Briefing </a>where Josepha, Mario and Ryan discuss the Interactivity API. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m curious about what you think.

There’s a lot to cover, and the team is excited to see it released. We’ve got bug fixes, performance improvements, and some breaking changes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’ve trimmed legacy code, removed some previously-deprecated APIs, removed some internal-only parameters to public functions that were never documented, and dropped support for some “magic” behaviors that were overly complicated.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The post includes an overview of the changes, starting with the highlight: dropping support for IE10 and older. The team planned to part with IE11 after Microsoft ended support in 2022 but <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5077#issuecomment-1730205609\">eventually decided</a> to push this change to v5 to avoid any more blockers to the v4 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming release uses ES modules and switches from RequireJS to Rollup for packaging. It also removes 13 deprecated functions that “were either always meant to be internal or ones that now have native equivalents in all supported browsers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>78 Million Websites Use jQuery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adherence to modern browser behavior and specs is a common thread in the announcement post. Indeed, browsers have come a long way since January 2006, when jQuery was launched, Internet Explorer had a 90% market share, and front-end development was a constant struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, with <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=es6\">99.84% browser support</a> for ES6, a slew of well-supported <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API\">Web APIs</a>, and robust upgrades to CSS—when we can run a full-blown <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/\">WordPress instance in the browser</a> using WebAssembly—do we still need <a href=\"https://bundlephobia.com/package/jquery@3.7.0\">an 85.1 kB</a> DOM manipulation library?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1al08pe/comment/kpi131o\">the words of an opinionated Redditor</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Look, jQuery was incredible and it changed JS in incredible ways. It made the JS developer experience incredible because it was so inventive. And the JS community and TC39 implemented so many things that jQ did incredible. It was one of the goals of jQ &#8211; set standards and improve the JS language. And it worked. And it&#8217;s no longer needed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging by online statistics, the answer is an unequivocal “YES!”. jQuery might be the uncool kid in the front-end neighborhood, but its market share dwarfs the hipper frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on NPM, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery\">jQuery 3.7.1</a>, released in August 2023, boasts over 9 million weekly downloads and has more than 20k dependent packages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuiltWith <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/jQuery\">indicates</a> that over 78 million websites use jQuery, while W3Techs <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery\">reports</a> that “jQuery is used by 94.4% of all the websites whose JavaScript library we know. This is 77.1% of all websites.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Legacy Dependency</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the chief reasons for jQuery’s relentless popularity is being instrumental to the ecosystem. Namely, it’s bundled in WordPress Core and is part of numerous themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress’ adoption of React-based Gutenberg has lowered its dependency on jQuery. During a Developer Hours session hosted a week after Willison’s announcement, titled <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2024/02/13/developer-hours-javascript-for-modern-wordpress-development/\">JavaScript for modern WordPress development</a>, Automattic’s developer advocates Ryan Welcher and Nick Diego spent more than an hour diving into JS tools and techniques to build blocks and editor extensions; they didn’t once mention jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/10/04/the-performance-impact-of-using-jquery-in-wordpress-themes/\">post published</a> in October 2021 on the Make Themes blog, core contributor Felix Arntz urged theme developers to move away from jQuery to improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60478\">TRAC ticket opened</a> on the day of Willison’s announcement reported the news and enquired, “Is this something that wp core will be looking to implement?”. Andrew Ozz, Lead Developer at Automattic, replied, “Of course :)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 43% share of the CMS market, WordPress could be the serum of jQuery’s longevity.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"122\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jQuery-logo-500x122.png\" alt=\"jQuery\'s logo and tagline: write less, do more\" class=\"wp-image-154072\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The last time WP Tavern <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tag/jquery\">covered jQuery</a> was in 2020, when jQuery Migrate 1.4.1 was removed from WordPress 5.5, causing themes and plugins to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Core team’s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-jquery-migrate-helper/\">Enable jQuery Migrate Helper</a> plugin—<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/enable-jquery-migrate-helper-plugin-passes-10k-active-installs\">launched</a> to tackle these problems—is still maintained and has 100k active installs. It also has some glaring reviews about how helpful it is. Why would people building WordPress websites in 2024 need to use a plugin designed “as a temporary solution, enabling the migration script for your site to give your plugin and theme authors some more time to update, and test, their code.”?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Trailblazer that Moves the Web Forward</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer lies in an alarming comment found on W3Techs. A third of the websites that use jQuery run a version older than 3.x (3.0.0 was released in June 2016).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results correlate with <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/blog/jquery-idc-research\">a smaller-scoped study</a> conducted by the OpenJS Foundation and IDC in November 2023. Out of 509 survey respondents, 89% confirmed they use jQuery, with 56% deploying older versions, some no longer maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open-source and standardization expert Tobie Langel, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/papers.html#jquery\">speaking at</a> the W3C’s Secure the Web Forward workshop, believes “jQuery’s massive reach and longevity” puts it in a unique position: if securing jQuery means securing the web, then “Once again&#8211;and against all odds&#8211;jQuery can be a trailblazer and help move the web forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s already an ongoing effort: <a href=\"https://openssf.org/blog/2022/10/24/openssf-project-alpha-omega-invests-in-the-openjs-foundation-and-jquery-to-help-secure-the-consumer-web/\">In October 2022</a>, the <a href=\"https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/\">Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Project Alpha-Omega</a> awarded jQuery a $350k grant to “reduce potential security incidents for jQuery by helping modernize its consumers and its code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backed by industry giants like the Linux Foundation, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, and part of the OpenJS Foundation supported by GoDaddy, IBM, Joyent, and the Sovereign Tech Fund, jQuery seems like it will get to live to see more than just another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How about you?

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today a couple of guests, Ryan Welcher and Mario Santos, who have joined me to talk about the Interactivity API. This is an API that we&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while, and it&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s really specifically user-facing in its functionality but makes a lot of work streamlined for everyday developers, whether you are building something for yourself, for your family, or for a client. This whole project probably is gonna really speak to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hi, guys, and welcome to the show. First-time guests, both of you. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yes. First time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Well, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, like your name, what you do with WordPress, how you contribute to the project, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I can go first. My name is Ryan Welcher. I&#8217;m a developer advocate and sponsored by Automattic. Then, I contribute full-time to the WordPress project by creating documentation, doing live streams, creating videos, and just generally trying to be helpful in in the space to help engineers and extenders work with the various APIs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love the just generally trying to be helpful part. Mario, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Mario:</strong> He really is. He really does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m Mario Santos. I&#8217;m also a sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m more focused on the project management and developer. I consider myself a mix of both. Right now I&#8217;m working on projects that are focused on improving the developer experience especially. That can go from the Block API to the Interactivity API; that is the topic today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Very nice. Very nice. Just lots of helping that everyone&#8217;s trying to do. I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about the Interactivity API today. And, Mario, I believe it was almost a year ago that you first put this proposal out into the WordPress project. Do you wanna tell us a little bit about just, like, where the idea of this came from? Like, I know it wasn&#8217;t originally called the Interactivity API, but, like, what was you said you do some a bit of product, a bit of development. Like, what was it about this idea that was so important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:48] <strong>Mario:</strong> Yeah. Sure. So, basically, well, the proposal came, like, one year ago, but it has been in the works, like, for many years, I would say. Just to give a bit more context, previously, before being a sponsored contributor, I was working at a startup called Frontity Framework, and we were building a React framework to enable rich user experiences on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So basically, it was a framework for headless WordPress. And at some point, we became sponsored contributors, the idea was to bring those user experiences to those rich and cool websites that lead to WordPress. So, you don&#8217;t need an external framework to create them, and you can do that directly in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where the idea of the Interactivity API comes from. From there, we started exploring different possibilities and tailoring it more to WordPress to ensure it works with its APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think after many many months working on that, the Interactivity API is the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I just wanted to note that you started that answer with, like, the proposal was about a year ago, but the work had been happening for a long time. I think that&#8217;s generally true, and it&#8217;s not something that we always really acknowledge. This happens with patents also. This is going to be a strange tangent, but this is how we do in in my brain. This is how my brain works. So frequently, you&#8217;ll see a brand new product, but the patent for it was, like, 30 years beforehand, like, way before you ever see anything. And I think that&#8217;s kinda how this works also with software development. Like, the idea, has been going for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The problem was identified a long time ago. And by the time you see something that helps to solve the problem or bring a new set of features to you, like, you didn&#8217;t know, but it had been being worked on for, like, five years or something. And I think that&#8217;s such a fascinating thing. That&#8217;s always apparent to me, but I think it&#8217;s not really apparent for a lot of people in the, in I don&#8217;t know, who use software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna say in the space, quote, unquote, but that&#8217;s not even it. Like, it&#8217;s the people who are using software. We don&#8217;t know how long anything&#8217;s been under development. We just know that at some point, a magical thing appeared, and we get to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So speaking of the problems that we have identified that we&#8217;re trying to solve with this. Like, was there an inherent problem that you all were trying to solve as you were coming up with this idea around the Interactivity API itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say that trying to summarize it, it covers many things, but the main problem was that creating those kinds of interactions in the client was kind of difficult. You had to manage many things many tools, and each developer could come up with different solutions, and maybe they don&#8217;t combine well together. So, the idea is to provide an extended way so developers don&#8217;t have to take care of many things. They just have to take care of the interactions they wanna create. And ensuring that it works well with the WordPress way, it works well with the block system, and any block created with this Interactivity API can communicate with each other. You can combine those blocks, and you are not gonna encounter any problem. So, I would say that the main issue we were trying to solve is that there wasn&#8217;t a standard solution. There were different approaches taken by different developers, and that could create some issues. So, until now, Gutenberg has been mainly focused on the editor side and how blocks are created. And this is a first attempt to to cover the part of the front end, the interactions that users may want to create in the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Ryan:</strong> It solves a ton of problems. But, I mean, coming from someone like, I have a fair amount of agency experience. I&#8217;ve been, you know, you&#8217;re working on large projects. And every time someone solves a problem, they solve it slightly differently. And that&#8217;s problematic because you switch teams or, you know, someone else picks up the code base, and all of a sudden, now they have to learn your custom system that&#8217;s slightly different from the one that I built last week and the one that, you know, someone else built two weeks earlier. And this takes the guesswork out. It takes the sort of the plumbing out of the equation. One of the reasons I really loves working with WordPress when I started working with WordPress was that when I was building for clients, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building the CMS. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building a menu system or figuring out how to handle media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I just had to do the things that that client was paying me to do. Like, I just had to make their site look the way that they wanted it to. And with the Interactivity API, I think there&#8217;s a bit of that where I don&#8217;t have to worry about figuring out how am I gonna get all these pieces to talk to each other on the front end. It&#8217;s all there. I just have to connect the dots, and it makes it very, very simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m building the site right now for a workshop that I&#8217;m gonna be giving a WordCamp Asia, which is a a shameless plug. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Coming up so fast, y&#8217;all. WordCamp Asia is, like, two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. I have so much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve built an entire voting system on a website where people can pick what we&#8217;re going to be talking about in my workshop, and I built it in the Interactivity API, and it took me, you know, probably five hours. And that&#8217;s me trying to learn some things and mess around with it. And to do that without the Interactivity API would have probably been an entire React-based, you know, completely outside of WordPress. I would have loaded one thing on the page and had it build out my whole application, and now I&#8217;m doing it with blocks and I&#8217;m doing it with a block theme. So if I wanna move those blocks around. I can move the blocks around. I can change anything that I wanna change inside of WordPress the way I would normally, and all that in interactivity just still works. And that&#8217;s It&#8217;s awesome. I just I love it. I can&#8217;t like, the Interactivity API, not my website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also both. Like, it can be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> I wanted to say that I think it&#8217;s a great point. I like to think about it like having the best of both worlds. Right now, we have modern frameworks like React, Vue that are used to create these cool websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the Interactivity API plus WordPress brings everything together. Like, you can create those cool user experiences while keeping the full power of WordPress, its management system, the Block editor, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything like that out there. Like having the best of both both worlds because we are still working with blocks, and that&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Given that it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s not even been released yet. Like, it&#8217;s coming very soon. But.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. This is all still in the Gutenberg plugin. So, like, if you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, get the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> But just how mature the API is now, considering it is still kind of not even fully released, it&#8217;s only gonna get better? I just think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, kudos to Mario and your team for doing all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve a question that I think probably, Ryan, you can start with, but then also probably, Mario, you&#8217;re gonna have some opinions on also. In this conversation so far, we&#8217;ve done a lot of, like, when you want to have these interactions and also when you want to have these cool experiences. For folks who actually do not know what the Interactivity API is yet, and they don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about when we say these interactions like, what exactly are we talking about from a user perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what types of things will users be able to see when they are experiencing the Interactivity API&#8217;s features and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a great question. From a user standpoint, it&#8217;ll just look like your regular website, I think. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing. So, like the interactions that we&#8217;re talking about is when you&#8217;re in the browser and you wanna click a button and expand something, for example, or you wanna click an image and have the lightbox pop-up, which is in core now, that&#8217;s driven by the Interactivity API, but these interactions are basically when a user wants to interact with something, what it does. That&#8217;s a really generic way of saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Our current favorite example and, Ryan, it sounds like you also have another example. But our current favorite example is like a movie collection site, you know? And so, like, when we&#8217;re talking about what the Interactivity API is going to power, it&#8217;s things like, when you favorite a series of movies, and then you can, and it just updates that on the fly, and you&#8217;ll be able to in essentially real-time as instant as reasonably possible based on your computer and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, then look at your list of things that you favorited or things like that. Like, for folks who don&#8217;t understand interactive site like, all of us know that that, like, if you get on a site, you have interacted with it. But when we&#8217;re talking about Interactivity API, we&#8217;re talking about types of direct actions users can take. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just only triggered by some actions. It could be scrolling, clicking, or, or whatever. But, it can go from a simple example like drop down or a popover to more complex things like the movies demo, where you can navigate and the page is not reloading, and that allows you to play a trailer. It starts in a pop-up, and you can keep navigating through different pages, and the trailer keeps playing without reloading. Another example could be instant search; like you start typing the search, and it directly updates the list of films, in this case, that are shown, those kinds of things that happen In the browser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And Ryan said you, you said that you, like, built a whole survey system, A whole polling system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah, a voting system. So there&#8217;s a series of buttons, each one representing a certain topic, and people can vote, and it tallies the amount. So each, I&#8217;m calling them recipes, has amount of time associated with it, and then so you vote until you run out of time, at which point, like in its tracking it all, and it&#8217;s showing you how much time you voted, how much is left, and once you&#8217;ve run out of time it blurs like it disables all of the voting buttons so you can&#8217;t add more because you run out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So if you remove one, you can add again. It&#8217;s very, very powerful. And, like, before the Interactivity API, you would have to have, I would have built that whole thing in React, and it would have been one single application that just get loaded on a page. And I just think it&#8217;s amazing. And, like the, the ability to create what are called, like, single page applications or what have always sort of been called SPAs or single page applications where you&#8217;re not reloading the browser every single time you click on a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to do some things to make that work, but that&#8217;s just available to you and in WordPress. That&#8217;s amazing. I just think that&#8217;s so neat. I mean, it&#8217;s already powering things like the Query Loop block has the ability to move pagination without reloading the page, which is, sounds like a sort of a like a okay, great, like sort of, you know, mundane thing but imagine you had two or three different query loops sitting on your homepage and you wanted to be able to paginate through each one and not refresh the page. That&#8217;s a fantastic user experience that now is just enabled and otherwise was not possible prior to the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I feel like the Query Loop block was, like, a three-year project four years ago. And I had forgotten about it, which is surprising because I was so concerned with it when we were working directly on it all the time. But yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve talked about kind of the user thing and people who are gonna build stuff for clients. But, like, if you&#8217;re a contributor and you want to figure out more about either how to use this or how to expand on what is already there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We already talked about how it&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s kind of experimental over there. But, like, do you all have like, good first bugs? Things that can be worked on in there? Or is there, like, an experiment zone where people can just be like, this is what I tried with the Interactivity API until it broke? How do people work with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would like to clarify first, it&#8217;s right now, it&#8217;s private in, it&#8217;s a private API in WordPress core in 6.4, And it&#8217;s public in Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s gonna be a public API already in WordPress 6.5. So, yes. Anyone can start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get involved is first sharing what interactions you want to see. I mean, everyone has different ideas, and we will love to know the interactions that people want to create using the Interactivity API, so that would be the first step. Then, test it, create your own blocks or site, and send feedback what do you like what you don&#8217;t like. Raise issues, and for that, we are mainly using GitHub. We created a new category in GitHub in the Gutenberg plugin discussions, and we try to to keep everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So if you have any questions any feedback, you can share it there. You can also find more discussions about the road map, the change log, many things that are going on right now. And, yeah, I would say those are the ways of getting involved, and I can also expect, maybe Ryan can tell you more here, to start working more on tutorials or videos or whatever. And for me, personally, I would love to see the community working on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah. I can, yeah. I think that from a contributor standpoint, especially those who are trying to get into contributing, because, I mean, it&#8217;s not not complicated. Let&#8217;s put it that way, like the Interactivity API. And that&#8217;s not meaning to be a barrier to anyone, but a great place to start is documentation. A great place to start is going through those docs and making sure they&#8217;re up to date and, you know, saying, oh, well, that&#8217;s supposed to do this, so let me go try that. And if it works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, file a bug, update the documentation, that&#8217;s a great way to get started. It&#8217;s gonna familiarize yourself with the code base and what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And then, sort of, just through osmosis, you&#8217;ll start to pick up more about it. And for anyone starting to contribute to the WordPress project in general, I would say starting with documentation or unit testing is a really, really great way to kinda, dip your toe in the water and not feel too frustrated. And tutorials and demos and show us what you&#8217;re building. We wanna see it. I mean, send it to me, and I will show everyone that I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I mean, we wanna see what what people are building with it and because, you know, just like WordPress, I always use this example, but, like, people used to hack WordPress until we got a hook added for that particular thing that they were adding. So, if we don&#8217;t know what people are building or wanting to build with it, we can&#8217;t make those things happen. So knowing what people are building, how they&#8217;re building, and what they can&#8217;t build, what they&#8217;re running into, what issues they&#8217;re running into is the best way to contribute. So, so people smarter than me can build it for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that call out, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, the theory of tech adoption. And for things like the Interactivity API where we&#8217;re still kind of in the early adopter phase like, Ryan, you&#8217;re an early adopter. You&#8217;re doing everything you think you want to be able to do until it breaks. And, like, I love, like, test it till it fails as a concept of how to get involved in something because, like, you&#8217;re just experimenting, and we encourage experimentation in open source and in open source software and certainly in WordPress. And so, like, it is an unusual thing to think of, like, the best way that I can give back to this project, that I can contribute to this project and make sure that it continues to succeed long term is by using it until the wheels fall off and then tell people what made the wheels fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that is a change in thought, But you&#8217;re right. Like, it&#8217;s a very old school open source idea to just get in there and see where it breaks, and tell us. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all we need. And I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But I just passed my 9-year anniversary being a sponsored contributor, and I was in WordPress for a little bit before it. And so, like, I&#8217;m officially the old guard of us, and so the fact that I&#8217;m, like, so excited about the fact that people are gonna come in and break Mario&#8217;s stuff. Mario, don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s how it works. But also, like, I do find that very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m willing to see how people break things; that&#8217;s what we need. I totally agree with your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. So I do have kind of, just, like, a final question for y&#8217;all. If there were one thing that you wanted the people who are listening to the WordPress Briefing to know about the Interactivity API, like a hidden gem, a little secret trick. Like, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Mario:</strong> For me, the most exciting part of the Interactivity API is the functionality the client-side navigation enables because there are many, many things there. And I&#8217;m sure that there are many things we haven&#8217;t thought about yet, and the community will come up with some ideas and that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Ryan:</strong> For me, the thing is, I love how integrated it is with WordPress, and I know a lot of thought has gone into that without getting too into the weeds. The reasons the decisions that were made were made was so all the hooks and filters and all that goodness that we&#8217;ve had for 20 years is still gonna work. And with the HTML API, the tag processor stuff that&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, it&#8217;s just so cool. It works so well with WordPress. It just works and that&#8217;s probably it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I work with it, I&#8217;m not having to do any weird janky filtering or stuff that, like, you know, the things that I want to do are not hindered by the Interactivity API. The rather, I&#8217;m able to do more things because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> I prefer Ryan&#8217;s answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Mario:</strong> It&#8217;s something really important and it&#8217;s something we usually take for granted that it just works with WordPress APIs and the Block Editor, but if you think more about it, it&#8217;s amazing. Like, It&#8217;s what makes it really powerful, I I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For what it&#8217;s worth, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of, like, the R&amp;D type things that we&#8217;re working on in the project right now. Right? Across Our ecosystem, like WP Playground. It is mind-boggling how progressive that is as a concept, and we currently have, like, you know, 25 ideas about what we could do with it, and we&#8217;re currently working on, like, five because we&#8217;ve got two and a half developers on it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like, the expectation that it will just work is there for everybody who has, is not part of the R&amp;D process, but for everyone else who&#8217;s, like, been watching its development over time, shocking. Shocking that it works at all. Not because it wasn&#8217;t supposed to work, but because, like, if someone had asked you five years ago if it was gonna be possible to run WordPress development environments locally and then also just export it and import it into whatever host you want. Like, without a host, without a server, we would all think that you were nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Amazing what&#8217;s happening there and, like, some of the things that we&#8217;re seeing, people who are, like, researching with AI in the WordPress space doing? Equally shocking. All of these things. Like, had you said anything to me about it five years ago, I&#8217;d be like, well, that is a mystery. So, every once in a while, I do have wild ideas about things that I wish we could do with our software. And so yesterday, I went and looked at a prototype for something that someone built based on a wish that I had in 2019. In 2019, I was like, you can play Skyrim on an Amazon Dot using just your voice. So like, why can&#8217;t we build a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then in 2021, someone prototyped that for me. It was ridiculous. It was very bad. It was hilarious. But, also, like, it took 35 minutes to create a &#8216;Hello world&#8217; page, which was ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, like, what we&#8217;re looking at, the research that I keep seeing from that AI space is people saying, like, I&#8217;m gonna put in a plain text prompt. I need a website as a yoga instructor who also makes custom hats. Right? And then, like, poof. You have this thing that kinda looks like a website with your basic functions and features using the blocks that we have created for WordPress. Like it&#8217;s fascinating how far it&#8217;s come. And that&#8217;s in 2021. It was literally impossible the last time that I was talking about it with anyone, equally literally impossible. Everyone&#8217;s like, plain language prompts for stuff, like that is just a pipe dream. Get away from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I keep seeing, like, these demos of the research, and it&#8217;s not as far away as we all thought it was. For all these things, Playground, Interactivity API, The AI research is being done. Like, we&#8217;re just a walking R&amp;D group over here in WordPress, and I love it. It&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re just making the impossible possible every day, and I think that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sorry. I got really sidetracked. Do y&#8217;all have anything that you wanted to be sure to share about either the Interactivity API or anything that&#8217;s coming up? Something you wanna make that our listeners know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would just like to emphasize that we love feedback. Please share your feedback. If you test it, yeah, if you think it&#8217;s bad feedback, share it with us as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s especially the feedback we like. I don&#8217;t like this part. That&#8217;s great. We we want to know because the idea is that it serves all purposes for this kind of interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That nothing new, but I would like to emphasize that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You know what? There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re good. You should always tell people what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Ryan:</strong> If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with the Interactivity API and just don&#8217;t have any idea where to begin, there&#8217;s actually a pack there. There&#8217;s a Create Block template. So the Create Block package allows you to to quickly scaffold blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a template that&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg repository. It&#8217;s been published on it and NPM. And it will scaffold a very simple block out for you and it&#8217;ll give you, it&#8217;ll show you all the plumbing and how all the pieces work together. So, I think that&#8217;s a fantastic place to get started. It&#8217;s a very simple block. It just basically shows and hides a message, but it&#8217;s all done via the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s a really, really great sort of, like, like, &#8216;Hello world&#8217; style. I&#8217;m gonna shamelessly self-promote myself at WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Asia this year doing a workshop where I will be doing some stuff with your Interactivity API. But, if you&#8217;re there and you wanna chat more about the Interactivity API, I am all ears, and I love talking about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Cool. Ryan, Mario thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So I hope that you all find that whole project as fascinating as I find it. The Interactivity API is, I know, something that we&#8217;ve kind of been talking about for a while. It showed up specifically in State of the Word, and it&#8217;s hard to understand how important, how vital that work is going to be until you really get your hands on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you get in there. You take a look at it. I think also Ryan has a few live streams that he does, and he&#8217;s planning on a couple for the Interactivity API coming up. And so just keep an eye out for all of that as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a bunch of feedback and documentation. So, first things first. Did you know that the Documentation Team holds an online monthly Contributor Day on the fourth Tuesday of every month. It&#8217;s just an online docs day, and I love it. So, the next one that&#8217;s coming up is February 27th. We&#8217;re looking for folks to help. So show up, figure out how to get some docs done, and make the WordPress project easier to follow, one bit of documentation at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I have is a request for feedback. So, we announced in December that we have a new centralized WordPress events landing page on WordPress.org, and we wanted to give more visibility to all kinds of WordPress events across the globe. But as always, we really could use your feedback about what is useful for you, what you had hoped to see, what you didn&#8217;t see. So, leave your comments with any relevant feedback about how you would improve those pages and the text on it. If you&#8217;re missing anything relevant, if there are ideas that you have for what could be there, all ideas are welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the third thing that I have on our list today is another documentation thing. So, over the last year, a group of contributors have been working to improve the block development onboarding experience within the Block Editor handbook. That contains over 400 published pages, and the effort in 2023 to kind of overhaul that and make it easier was just the beginning. So, it&#8217;s a daunting task. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s complex, but improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the WordPress project, especially If there are just quick fixes like typos or formatting. Feedback on the existing content, such as the new block tutorial, is invaluable. And so, if you have not taken a look at those yet, wander over to the show notes, click a link or two, take a look, get some feedback to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

The latest updates give you a new and improved way to view and rearrange the different parts of your website, like pages and designs, with ease. Now, with just a few clicks, you can choose how to see everything and decide what details you want to be visible. Think of it as organizing your workspace in a way that&#8217;s best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new tools are also preparing for more cool features to come in the future. Currently, these changes are only available for the website editing section, kind of like a test run. This allows people to try them out and give their thoughts, which helps decide how to introduce these helpful tools to other parts of the website-building process later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jamie Marsland</strong>, PootlePress, seems <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpUz5IIKlpw\"><strong>Something small but HUGE is coming to WordPress 6.5</strong></a>.

Unlike other similar products in the WordPress ecosystem which deliver functionality through plugins, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bricks-laying-down-a-foundation-in-the-wordpress-page-builder-market\">Bricks Builder</a> uses the theme functionality as it’s way of delivering features to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding RCE Vulnerabilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RCE vulnerabilities are among the most critical types of security flaws. They allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a website from a remote location, allowing them to control the site, access confidential data, distribute malware, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timeline of the Patch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability disclosure timeline is commendable for its efficiency. The flaw was reported to Bricks by security research team snicco on February 10, 2024, marking the start of a swift and effective response. Bricks acknowledged the issue on the same day and, by February 13, had released the patch (1.9.6.1) following snicco&#8217;s recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update Highly Recommended</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-themes/bricks/bricks-196-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution#:~:text=The%20Bricks%20theme%20for%20WordPress,execute%20code%20on%20the%20server.\">Wordfence</a> has labelled the severity of this vulnerability a 9.8 out of 10 while <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/bricks/wordpress-bricks-theme-1-9-6-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability\">Patchstack</a> has labelled it a 10 out 10, marking it a critical update for website owners using Bricks.

Moving forward, the organization hopes to promote open-source projects and the cause of the open web to legislators around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us in WordPress, regulatory oversight is probably a future we can anticipate. If we want to remain competitive in the enterprise/government space, we&#8217;ll need to figure out how to be more proactive at compliance and security and get better at sharing the positive open-source narrative.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The regulatory landscape that the WordPress community finds itself in today is vastly different from where we’ve been. Governments are accelerating their regulatory oversight of technology and introducing new legislation regularly to try and catch up with the pace of innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Europe recently we’ve seen two landmark pieces of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). While both have created news in technology circles it is the CRA that has been <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/concerns-over-the-european-unions-cyber-resilience-act-cra/\">of particular concern to the WordPress community</a> and other open-source projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/Open_Letter_on_the_Significance_of_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_in_the_EU_s_Proposed_Cyber_Resilience_Act.pdf\">open letter to EU legislators in July 2023</a>, the leaders of WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and TYPO3 highlighted the risks to open-source and began a collaborative effort called the Inter-CMS Working Group to bring about significant change to the wording proposed in the CRA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Impact of Collaborative Advocacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In early December, after several months of dialogue, investigation and negotiation, the EU parliament <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-17000-2023-INIT/EN/pdf\">released an updated draft of the legislation</a> that looks to have resolved many of the primary concerns raised by open-source communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revised Act makes a concerted effort to ensure that the regulations are practical and do not hinder the collaborative spirit or the ways of working that open-source projects like WordPress rely on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the success of amending the CRA as a foundation to build on, the four open-source communities represented in the Inter-CMS Working Group recently <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-co-founds-the-open-website-alliance\">established the Open Web Alliance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Alliance, <a href=\"https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/documents/press_releases/2024-02_Open_Website_Alliance/Open_Website_Alliance_Charter.pdf\">now formalized with a charter</a>, represents a collective commitment to furthering the education about and advocacy of open-source benefits and principles. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-7 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1880\" height=\"1253\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654.jpeg\" alt=\"Reichstag building in Berlin, Germany.\" class=\"wp-image-153916\" />Photo by Federico Orlandi on <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-and-brown-concrete-building-2871654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pexels.com</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Future of the Open Web Alliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance aims to promote and defend the rights of open-source projects, aspiring to create a better web. It emphasizes encouraging the use of open-source software, sharing best practices, and supporting third-party open-source projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This collaborative body, while not a legal entity, signifies a structured approach to ensuring open-source software remains a vibrant and integral part of the digital landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, the presence of the Open Web Alliance could be a game-changer in how open-source communities navigate regulatory challenges and advocate for policies that recognize and support the unique nature of open-source development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its charter underscores a commitment to openness, trust, and quality, offering a platform for open-source CMS projects to collaborate more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition toward a more formalized alliance underscores the WordPress community’s role not just in advocacy, but in shaping a future where open-source principles are acknowledged and protected in the global digital policy arena. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s foundation and its charter reflect a mature, strategic approach to ensuring that the ethos of open-source software continues to thrive amidst an evolving regulatory landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Navigating A Regulatory Future: Implications for WordPress Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent developments around the CRA and the active role of the (now) Open Web Alliance highlight a broader trend: the regulatory landscape impacting open-source software is evolving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WordPress businesses, the amendments to the CRA represent a momentary sigh of relief, but the horizon suggests that regulatory challenges will persist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a business perspective, the future willingness of enterprises and government entities to adopt open-source software may hinge on how effectively the community can navigate these regulations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s efforts to advocate for open-source principles–emphasizing security, reliability, and openness–become crucial in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth considering that the relationship dynamics between government entities, enterprises, and open-source vendors are likely to evolve. A failure to leverage open-source software due to regulatory or compliance concerns could limit innovation and flexibility for governments and businesses alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the WordPress ecosystem, this underscores the importance of supporting initiatives like the Open Web Alliance, ensuring that open-source software remains a viable, attractive option for all users, regardless of the regulatory climate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on education, advocacy, and the development of compliance tools, the WordPress community can help mitigate potential reservations from enterprise and government sectors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proactive stance not only defends the community’s interests but also promotes the fundamental advantages of open-source software in fostering innovation, security, and a more inclusive digital future.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>What do you think?

Additionally, a few questions were replaced or updated to ensure the survey captures relevant data on current and future WordPress topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data collected is used as one of many signals that inform the project&#8217;s road map and  areas of focus, both near and long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights from 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, awareness and/or use of block-based features is up year over year, as well as resources such as Learn.WordPress.org. This reflects project-wide efforts to increase utilization of these respectively. However, positive sentiment about WordPress is down modestly, and more so among contributors. The analysis of the annual survey highlights certain areas that could benefit from increased attention in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the highlights split into three parts: logistics, general trends, and contributor sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logistics</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Completions were up 17% in 2023, though short of a goal to double them, despite increased promotion and partnership with some hosting partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Polyglots team translated the survey from English into 9 different languages, the most ever for the survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Debuted a new platform, Alchemer, for improved accessibility, usability, data collection, administration, and analysis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The completion rate increased again from last year’s high of 63% to 79% in 2023, proving that investing some time in the new platform and clarifying wording was well worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General trends</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>NPS* was 30.1 overall, with contributors at 27.9 and non-contributors at 32. The NPS has trended downward since 2021, when it was 45. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>60% of respondents indicate usage of Gutenberg, 8% are unsure, and 12% use something other than Gutenberg and/or the Classic Editor. This is up from 2022 (54%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>45% of respondents indicate that the WordPress Site Editor meets their site-building needs, 26% are indifferent, and 29% disagree.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61% of respondents indicate familiarity with block themes and plugins. While this question was not asked previously, in 2022, 53% said they had used blocks<br />“In the new site editor.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security, performance, and stability were the top three critical areas respondents considered when building their website, plugin, theme, or style variation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63% agree that WordPress is as good or better than other CMSs, down from 68% in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents indicated that the best things about WordPress are that it is open source, has ample plugin options, incorporates good customization, is easy to use, and offers flexibility. This is similar to 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limitless configurations, performance, scalability, accessibility, integration, hosting, and support all saw 100% or more increases compared to 2022 regarding favorite things about WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents cited “too many plugins,” “the site editing experience,” “security,” and “performance” as the top four worst things about WordPress. Most interestingly, though, 16% indicated that none of the 20 topics were terrible, and there was a 43% decrease in the number of people indicating that “site editing is difficult to learn.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search engines and YouTube continue to be the two most common resources for finding information about WordPress, while those writing about WordPress, in general, saw a sharp decline year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor sentiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>58% of self-identified contributors to WordPress said they agree with the project’s roadmap plans for “Phase 3” and “Phase 4” as a good plan to enhance the WordPress experience for developers, creators, and publishers alike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While about one-third of respondents indicated they contribute to the WordPress project, only about half knew how to get involved, knew about WordCamps and meetups, understood the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, and knew the benefits of open source.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of 22 topics, the distribution of the top three things that WordPress needs to focus on from the perspective of contributors was broad, with only a 13.5% raw percentage point (1350 basis points) difference between performance (18.6%) in first position and collaborative editing (5.1%) in 22nd position. This shows a need for more consensus among contributors regarding where to focus resources and/or illustrates that the project has many essential elements with passionate supporters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fewer contributors had a positive experience in 2023 (55%) versus 2022 (64%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the feeling of being welcome in the WordPress community among contributors decreased to 57% versus 64% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furthermore, contributors feel appropriately recognized less in 2023 (46%) than in 2022 (51%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 annual WordPress survey participation and results highlight the possibility of survey burnout within the WordPress community and some declining overall satisfaction among contributors. There is an opportunity to increase awareness regarding critical initiatives such as WordCamps and other resources for WordPress users and contributors alike and to increase messaging on improvements made within the project to the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s planned for 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the survey’s questions further to ensure they continue to provide valuable insight into the project’s trends. This means some questions will be replaced while others might be refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, plans are being explored to distribute and promote the survey at each of the three annual flagship WordCamps (Europe, U.S., and Asia). This would be in contrast to a single yearly survey. More exploration on this topic will take place in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/02/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey-Results-Deck.pdf\">View the 2023 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reporting.alchemer.com/r/738278_655bbaa5598b14.93675163\">View a web-based version of the results.</a> <em>Note that this link may expire in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score-calculation\">What is NPS?</a> Simply put, NPS is a KPI organizations can use to measure how likely it’s [users, clients, members] are to recommend a product or service.

You’ll find more ways to manage your fonts and styles, notable upgrades to synced patterns, a collection of Site Editor and performance updates to help you get things done, and new ways to leverage design tools in Classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will include breakthrough foundational APIs that will start to transform how you use blocks to build memorable experiences. This release invites you to dig into these early-stage frameworks, discover how you’d like to see them evolve, and have an impact on their future improvements and capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excited yet? Keep reading for some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially slated for release in WordPress 6.4, the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59166\">Font Library</a> is one of those great things worth the wait. It gives you new capabilities for efficiently managing a vital piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Font Library, you can handle fonts across your site regardless of your active theme—much like how you manage assets in the Media Library. You can install local fonts or Google Fonts, and it’s easily extensible, with the ability to add your own custom typography collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synced patterns get an upgrade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/\">Synced patterns</a> bring efficiency to the design process, letting you make global changes to particular layouts with minimal effort. However, there’s often a need to make contextual changes when it comes to content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 introduces new enhancements to synced patterns that let you override the content in each specific instance. You can choose what content can be updated within a synced pattern—while maintaining the design and layout you’ve already created. Use it for templated pieces like recipes, testimonials, or case studies that use recurring elements to frame unique content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This major release will introduce overrides for the Paragraph, Image, Heading, and Button blocks, with support for more blocks to come as work on synced patterns continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting blocks and custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will finally make it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53300#issuecomment-1938463648\">connect core block attributes to custom fields</a>. This capability lets you use the value of a custom field without creating custom blocks. For example, a digital publication could use custom fields with Paragraph and Image blocks. It could pull information from its individual staff writer profiles to dynamically display on its team page, like headshots and names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">Block Bindings API</a> powers this functionality and is designed to be extensible enough for developers to connect blocks to any dynamic content—not just custom fields. If your data is stored elsewhere, you can easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first step in a larger project to simplify how custom fields and other dynamic content are managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API gets baked into Core</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as just a taste in WordPress 6.4 with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">lightbox feature for images</a> is officially making its way into Core. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks\">Interactivity API</a> is a new framework that offers developers a standardized method to bring interactive front-end experiences, or interactions, to blocks. It aims to simplify the process, with less dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interactions create engaging user experiences, whether showing new comments or fetching search results without reloading a page, allowing visitors to interact with content in real time, or incorporating effects like countdowns and transitional animations that surprise and delight. Check out <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">this demo site to get a taste of what this framework can do</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.5 is just the beginning of bringing this developer experience into Core. Find out how you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56803\">follow along with the work or lend a hand</a> and test more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more from your revisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions are the markers of progress. For creative projects, they&#8217;re also a welcome fallback when you&#8217;re working through a new design or concept. This release brings more detail to your style revision history in the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/22/core-editor-improvement-robust-revisions-in-the-site-editor/\">Style revisions in 6.5</a> present a more detailed picture of your work, with design updates like time stamps, quick summaries that outline changes, and the ability to see a full list of revisions made—not just the previous 100. View revisions from the Style Book to see changes that aren&#8217;t reflected in the template you&#8217;re working on. Style revisions are also newly available for templates and template parts, giving you a broader view of your site’s changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">work happening to expand and improve revisions across the WordPress experience</a>. It’s a foundational part of the collaborative editing and workflows focus of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classic themes can opt into appearance tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the design experience in Block themes evolves and improves, many of these upgrades are also available for Classic themes. Theme authors can choose to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60118\">add support for appearance tools to any Classic theme</a>—even without the use of theme.json. Opting in gives designers and site creators using Classic themes access to a varied set of design options, from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-theme-json.php#L576\">spacing and border controls to typography and color options</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching themes can feel like a big undertaking, and for folks who aren’t ready to jump into the flexibility of Block themes, these pathways to adoption can help ease that tension. Once a Classic theme gets initial support for appearance tools, more design options will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More design tools are on the way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each WordPress release brings more thought and attention to the way you can create with the Site Editor. The latest improvements to the design experience help bring your creative vision to life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/57005\">Background images for Group blocks get size and repeat support</a>, letting you play with subtle or splashy ways to add visual interest to your layouts.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56897\">Aspect ratio support for the Cover block</a> gives you more control over your Cover block images’ shape and size.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57103\">Shadow support added to more blocks</a> to help create layouts with visual depth or add a little personality to your design.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Site Editor updates to streamline your workflow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring ease and simplicity to your site-building process with the latest advancements to the Site Editor’s capabilities, from important interface improvements to upgraded tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going beyond Group blocks, you can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54426\">rename every block in the List View</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55188\">rename</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55292\">duplicate</a> individual patterns to help keep them organized. Other notable UI improvements add access to your block settings with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50273\">quick right-click from List View</a>, adjust preferences with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56510\">consolidated settings in the Editor preferences panel</a>, and the ability to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56295\">block toolbar on hover when you’re in Distraction Free mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also notice a cleaner and more unified link-building experience that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50891\">improves link controls</a>, making it easier to create and manage links in various blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release has a bounty of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33683\">drag-and-drop enhancements</a> to make your editing experience feel more intuitive. You’ll notice helpful visual adjustments, like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56625\">displaced items in List View</a> when you drag them around to reorganize. You’ll also find that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56070\">drag and drop anywhere you’d like</a> in the Editor, from the very beginning to the end of your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Data Views in the Site Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every piece of your site comes with a library of information and data. Organizing it, finding what you need, and making informed changes should be as effortless as your site editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 includes <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/55083\">data views</a> for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts. You can view data in a table or grid view, with a new UI for toggling fields and making bulk changes. It’s a refreshing and feature-rich experience that leads the way for the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">Admin Redesign project</a> on the WordPress roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin dependencies improve the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 improves <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57545\">how users manage plugins that require other plugins</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs from the WordPress.org Plugins repository, which will present users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Required plugins must remain active and installed for as long as plugins that require them are active and installed. If any required plugins become inactive or uninstalled, the plugins that require them will be automatically deactivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big performance gains across the editing experience and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 contains more than 110 performance-related updates, including an impressive <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">increase in speed and efficiency</a> across both the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed increasing to nearly four times faster than the previous release. You’ll also find yourself navigating through the Site Editor six times faster than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loading time for translated sites gets a boost due to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merging Performant Translations into Core</a>. This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that WordPress remains highly accessible is crucial for its success and fulfilling the mission of democratizing publishing. With this in mind, 6.5 will ship more than 65 updates to improve accessibility throughout the platform. These updates include fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.

The Super Bowl centers around a number of interesting stories in my life, such as when I was in high school and very poor the Super Bowl was in Houston, and they made McNuggets really cheap, so I ate 104 McNuggets in one sitting. (Sweet and sour sauce, natch.) At that infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy\">Justin Timberlake / Janet Jackson moment</a>, they needed extras on the field to be their audience and my high school girlfriend was one of the kids in the audience when it happened.

This has been a good stress test for the moderation team, we&#8217;ve done a pretty good job keeping up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see the submitted photos visit <a href=\"https://photos.wpkerala.org/\">https://photos.wpkerala.org/</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-6535_bc820e-8f\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6535_f27161-0f alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6535_52d065-7c inner-column-1\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6535_c54615-e0 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><a href=\"https://hallwaychats.com\">WPPhotos.Info</a></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://wpphotos.info/sharks-on-the-sand/\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/40365b3f9f700cfa6.90654423-scaled-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"A group of sharks laying on the sand.\" class=\"wp-image-6538\" /></a></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/faisalahammad/\">Faisal Ahammad</a>, shared his story about the WPPhoto of the week:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My four friends and I visited Malaysia and Singapore last September to attend&nbsp;<strong>WordCamp Malaysia 2023</strong>.

So why are tech companies laying off workers?</a> This article has some good data, but I think misses the point with sub-heads like &#8220;Shine has come off the tech industry.&#8221; Really? How is that reflected in their stock prices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a few things are happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, tech companies are typically best at adopting new technology, which leads to productivity gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI may be an obvious example of this, though for all its hype it hasn&#8217;t had a huge impact on most companies yet. I agree with Sam Altman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1752753792058294725\">when he says there may someday be a billion-dollar company run by one person</a> who is able to highly leverage future AI agents to automate most traditional roles at a company. That said, I think there are advantages to teams including allowing people to go on vacation or take time off, and provide business continuity and succession, so literally one-person is probably an exaggeration. We don&#8217;t need AI to see very small teams being valued highly: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2946785/facebook-instagram-acquisition\">Instagram had only 13 employees when it sold for a billion dollars to Facebook</a>, in 2012!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of this productivity gains just come from adoption of existing tools like Google Workspace or Office 365, issue trackers and version control with tools like Gitlab, Github, or Jira. At Automattic we don&#8217;t use email to work or communicate internally, it&#8217;s all Slack and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">P2</a>. We also leverage our <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/\">distributed</a> nature to effectively have teams around the world coordinating several shifts of product work per day, and 24/7 coverage for things like systems and customer support without the need for &#8220;graveyard shifts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way tech companies operate, the pace and culture, would be unrecognizable to people at many more traditional companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tech companies some roles are highly leveraged, like systems, engineering, and design, and everything else in the company really exists to support these. These leveraged roles can create enormous amounts of value, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not unusual to hear of machine learning engineers working on ads at Google with salaries in the seven figures. (There&#8217;s been a weird accounting thing where companies put a lot of their compensation into equity, but I think that&#8217;s going away as investors are learning to better account for dilution and employees appreciate the fungibility of cash.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators are also highly leveraged, which is why <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/joe-rogan-podcast-spotify-deal-28eb5f74\">Joe Rogan can sign a new $250M deal with Spotify</a> (which smartly puts him back on Youtube) after laying off 1,500 people in December. Some people like <a href=\"https://hagenterschueren.com/\">Hagen Terschüren</a> try to <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@hagen/111863148058114596\">tie this together and say you should avoid Spotify for it</a>, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a business becoming more efficient to serve its customers, it&#8217;s the whole point of capitalism. Capitalism is, as Nicholas Stern says (<a href=\"https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/\">via Marc</a>), the best way to take care of people we don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s no honor in keeping people employed inefficiently, it&#8217;s better for them to find someplace in the market where their talents will be better leveraged for society and themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a bubble in hiring because tech had so much money it tried to throw people at problems. But the unlock in technology can come from a single person, a single insight. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month\">It&#8217;s the mythical man-month</a>. Tech-first companies are going to become leaner and more leveraged. Fewer people are going to create more value for society, in ways that will follow power laws and I think we should investigate things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income\">Universal Basic Income</a> to provide for all living beings. Technological progress creates abundance, where we have more than what we need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> last year we did not do layoffs, but allowed performance management and natural attrition (voluntary regrettable was 2.9%, non-regrettable 6.8% for us in 2023) to allow our size to shrink down more naturally, on average two people left for every person we hired last year, from a peak of about 2,064 to 1,936 today.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Feb 2024 02:33:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: Joshua Redman on Tiny Desk\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=111326\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://ma.tt/2024/02/joshua-redman-on-tiny-desk/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:985:\"<p>It&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite tenor player, but the GOATs that come to mind are Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Michael Brecker, and I&#8217;m missing people but if I had to pick someone to express the human condition and soul, it would be <a href=\"https://www.joshuaredman.com/\">Joshua Redman</a>.

Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible. By participating, you will better understand the project and its people, so you can advocate WordPress in a better way. It will offer you a sense of satisfaction or meaning as well as success in your career.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these open source contributor stories and grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>, or continue your own WordPress journey at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sunitarai/\">Sunita Rai&nbsp;</a>for sharing about her adventures in WordPress, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Abha Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nalini Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webtechpooja/\">Pooja Derashri,</a> <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meher Bala</a>, <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicholas Garofalo</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chloe Bringmann</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\">Maja Loncar</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mary Baum</a> for interviews, editorial, images, and reviews.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

This provides consistency in design across different pieces of content. (…) Additionally, folks would then be able to revisit and modify the design of the recipe pattern without affecting the content in existing instances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series of videos, you&#8217;ll see me creating a pattern from the theme&#8217;s patterns, setting the allowed overrides for content parts of the pattern, here heading block, button block und Image block</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I change a few styles of the pattern to make it my own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On three new pages, I use the pattern, change the headline, button text and link and and replace the image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In part three, I change the original synced pattern some more, and the changes are then immediately applied to the copies on those three pages as well. Pretty nifty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s go. <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json\">Use this link to load the WordPress Playground</a>.

A few questions came to my mind. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can a developer package patterns with overrides?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can I modify a theme pattern and not have to duplicate it? I probably can&#8217;t as it has its lock mechanism.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What would a theme developer have to do to create patterns that allow content overrides and update when the theme updates? </li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can I lock down the overrides for content creators?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> also created a stand-alone video on YouTube and invites you to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazJFdHItTGVXdDV6R3drWGhjX0lqSXdZUW5LQXxBQ3Jtc0tuM01XVmplSEk2Si1KTU1ZaWpTa1lYdFc2NjkyV2pqZ1JBQmZzZl9JVDV1aTNKaFNBdGktd3F5ZlBlUmt2YTVBMzFFQjliUDRCakpzMTVBblFtdi1vUURka0tIak40b1F2T3lnSzRFNV96R1RwbVZrMA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWordPress%2Fgutenberg%2Fdiscussions%2F57937&v=q53XXJdZXtY\"> join the discussion</a> around how you&#8217;d like to see this feature evolve beyond WordPress 6.5</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Notes </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the info section of the Pattern list, it still shows &#8220;Fully synced&#8221; (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58725\">#58725</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I didn&#8217;t succeed in changing the text of the button after I already changed the link.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox has a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how one company managed to pivot towards AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Ben Ritner. Ben is the founder of Kadence WP, a company that specializes in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021, Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand. Where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there&#8217;s a suite of popular plugins, including Learn Dash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact that it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI generated content and images. Ben&#8217;s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started right through to today, where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow. AI is still new, and it&#8217;s possible that what&#8217;s all the rage today will be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Ben Ritner. Hello, Ben.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Hey. Nice to be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you for joining me today. We&#8217;re going to talk today about AI. We&#8217;re also going to talk about Ben&#8217;s history with WordPress and Kadence, which is a product that Ben launched quite a little while ago, but he can tell you all about that. But first, Ben, just so that the audience know who you are, and what your relationship is with WordPress, a moment to give us your potted bio, if that&#8217;s all right. So over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. So I&#8217;m the founder of Kadence WP, which is a company that develops themes and plugins for WordPress, primarily focused on the front end of your website. So, how do you make that website look good, responsive, fast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re, you know, kind of in that page builder space, but we&#8217;re doing it from a blocks perspective. So we&#8217;ve got a package of blocks, that enable you to do a lot more with the core Gutenberg editor, than what comes in core. And at this moment, I&#8217;m part of the senior leadership team of StellarWP, which is a umbrella brand that Kadence is under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadence was acquired in 2021. And so now I&#8217;ve moved in with the Stellar org, and we have a number of popular plugins in our suite, including LearnDash, and the events calendar GiveWP. So, yeah, that&#8217;s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, great. Thank you so much. We are going to dwell a little bit on AI. In fact, I think the primary focus of this will be to touch on AI, but we&#8217;re going to come at it from different angles. We&#8217;ll talk about the products that you&#8217;ve got, although that may not be the primary focus of what we talk about. But we&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about ethics maybe, or, you know, how AI works, and how it might affect the job market, and whether we&#8217;re doing ourselves out of work in the future, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the first questions I&#8217;ve got for you is surrounding the software that you build. Now, you can go into the details of it if you wish, that&#8217;s absolutely fine. Get into the weeds, and get all technical. I&#8217;m going to encourage users to go to the following url. So it&#8217;s kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai. If you want to find that in an easier way, go to WP Tavern, search for this episode, and it&#8217;ll be in the show notes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But over there you demonstrate how you can create, more or less an entire website. So completely from scratch. You&#8217;ve got a vanilla install of WordPress, you install all the bits and pieces that Kadence requires, and moments later, and I really do mean moments. I think you could probably achieve this in under three, four minutes. You&#8217;ve got yourself a functioning website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m interested to know, why you went down that route? What were the sort of, the things that you were thinking about? Why website building? Why not, oh I don&#8217;t know, just simply block building? I&#8217;m curious to know where you are getting your inspiration from. Because if we rewind the clock two years, nobody was talking about AI in the WordPress space, and those that were, were very prescient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everybody&#8217;s talking about it. There&#8217;s this landslide of products. And you must feel the commercial pressure to get these things right. So, how do you know? How do you judge that what you are building is the right thing for the company&#8217;s future? As opposed to just, well, guesswork really. Difficult question, but let&#8217;s begin there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So I think with Kadence, the decision making comes down to, we were really listening to our user base. And we had a product, we have a product called Kadence Starter Templates. Which is essentially a site that is designed, and has placeholder text, and allows you to import that as you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m going tolaunch a site quickly. Maybe it&#8217;s in my correct niche, because we had over 80 starter templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe the images are close to something I&#8217;m going to do, or maybe the text is close. But I&#8217;ve got to go in there and edit it, and make it my own. That starting place gets past that white screen of, what do I do, I&#8217;m staring at a white screen, and somehow I need to build a website from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was immensely popular. We saw all kinds of users using it, from the agencies using it as a, I want to get started quickly on a site, that they had already had designed for, but they wanted to use the starter template because they just wanted it to be built out to where they could edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we saw, you know, freelancers using it. We saw hobbyists using it. And essentially, when we went in to look at, what&#8217;s the easiest way to implement AI, to make that faster and better for users? How do we make that white screen problem of, I don&#8217;t know what to do next, easier for users? And there&#8217;s a lot of focus right now on prompt based communication with the AI, where it&#8217;s really on, how good are you at writing a prompt to an AI to get stuff back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we kind of just wanted to approach, can we take our starter templates product, and just make the content, the images, and the text, be filled with AI data? Images, we&#8217;re still a ways out from, because AI generated images are pretty poor at this time, and expensive. What we do use, is we use AI to search Pexels, and then pull in images that are in that same vein for what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a good starting point, but is it a launch site? No. Like, there&#8217;s nothing about our product, or even where we&#8217;re trying to go, where we&#8217;ll say, you can launch and don&#8217;t need to edit. Part of it is because AI is not that good. But there is a sense of, are you 80% there? And that, I think, is really intriguing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, in our minds, this was step one. Ideally we can get to 90% there. Because I think once AI images gets better, and being able to tell the AI specifically, hey, we&#8217;ve got a hero here, there&#8217;s this text , we want an image for that background, you know, we will get there eventually. But as far as like our decision making into what are we going to build, it really came out of, what are people using and like, and how do we make that experience better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you were in the, well, lucky isn&#8217;t the right word, but you&#8217;re in the enviable position, that you already had the stack of things that really were required. And it was just a case, well, just a case, it was a case of tweaking the things that you already had. So the starter templates, and what have you. And that&#8217;s the decision that you made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s curious, because I&#8217;ve seen quite a lot of commercial products come out of nowhere, and they&#8217;re trying to do exactly the same thing. So in a sense, you had a lot of that stack in place, which must have made it, well, again, I don&#8217;t mean to use the word easy, but it must have made it slightly easier for you to build on top of what you already had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. It definitely made it, it made the story easy to tell. Because I think that&#8217;s part of the issue when you&#8217;re talking about AI is, how do you explain this to your users in a way where you can show them how this is going to benefit, and make their lives easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were also like, we know the problems that come with the current way that we were doing starter templates. Which was essentially, we have a dummy site that actually lives on a server somewhere, and you&#8217;re just copying that to your local site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had thought about, what if we broke this down to be a section by section thing? Where we don&#8217;t actually have a dummy site that lives somewhere. What we have is a library of sections, that can go throughout any kind of pages, and then we&#8217;ll live on your site, put those sections together with content, to build out the pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we took the idea of starter templates and just said, let&#8217;s rechange the technology behind it, so it&#8217;s better and more flexible, and then add in AI generated content and images that can be changed on the fly, and are specific to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have some other AI tools built in. What&#8217;s interesting is, you know, we started with, can we get starter templates, and then we backed off. But what we need to do is figure out the sections piece. How do we get AI into sections, and then we pulled that back out to like, okay, now we can do pages and then websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really interesting to think through where we can go with AI. And I think what your original question was getting at is, how do you choose where to go? And we had a path of like, here&#8217;s an easy story, and here&#8217;s how we can implement it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I think about, where is AI going, what&#8217;s the future, what&#8217;s it going to look like? AI, to me, is a very good tool at doing iterative work. When you ask an AI to improve something, it generally does a pretty good job. And when I&#8217;ve, you know, in my life, and experiencing with using AI tools, the best results usually come from a feedback loop of, it presents you options, and you either choose, I like this one, or you ask for edits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t have a tool that does that very well. We have some inline text options, but it&#8217;s pretty basic. And what&#8217;s interesting for me, just because of using AI for myself, where I feel like our next realm of where we want to go to, is a more iterative thing, because I&#8217;ve seen that AI does a better job when we go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So part of that decision making, of like, where are we going? It&#8217;s based on, I use ChatGPT every day, pretty much. And when I get the best results from it, is when I&#8217;ve said, okay, that&#8217;s close, but edit this, or change this. And I think that iterative approach, if we can bring that into a UI, can be really interesting when we talk about, how do we build very custom and interesting layouts inside of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So our challenge right now is, what does a page wizard look like that&#8217;s iterative, that allows you to say, I want this page to be about this, show me some examples? We show you some examples, and then you choose the one that&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m feeling this, don&#8217;t like that section, I would like more on this, and then generate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, to me, could get really interesting, in terms of like getting you to that 90% of like, this page is 90% there, and I&#8217;m going to go in and tweak some of the text. But yeah, I think that&#8217;s all kind of how we&#8217;re choosing where to go is, trying and playing with the AI ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It almost sounds like you are envisaging a future, in which you have a conversation with a page. So you&#8217;ve got something in front of you, maybe that was generated by something, using your templates. But maybe it was something that you created yourself. And then the AI is somehow in a conversation where you discuss, and you say, I would like the headline to be shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, right, give me several options, we&#8217;ve done that. That image is in the wrong place, can we move that round to the other side? And that picture of a cat, replace it with a picture of a lion or, you get the idea. So you are talking, in effect, to the page. Am I describing your intuitions there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yes. Although I am scared of anything that relies on us to prompt the AI. So, I do want to have that talking, but I want to really focus on, rather than doing too much of, you can just raw text in, because that&#8217;s that same problem with the white page of like, I don&#8217;t know what to ask the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to do a lot more of, we&#8217;re going to give you options, choose the one you like, and then mini select options inside of that. Or like, where we can guide that to where it&#8217;s really just a bunch of clicks, instead of relying on you to communicate well with an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The pace of AI is moving so quickly. I really meant it when I said that two years ago, nobody was talking about it. I have no recollection of it being an important subject in the WordPress space. And now it seems to be almost everything that I hear, be it on mainstream media, or in the tech press or in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow AI manages to get itself in there, because everybody&#8217;s so fascinated by it. I just wonder where you get your inspiration from. Now it may be that there are commercial rivals inside of WordPress, you can mention things or not mention things. Or maybe there are things happening in the wider world that, you know, being where you are now in the tech space, and the company that you work for, there&#8217;s probably tendrils that you can use via that company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s just other things that you&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS space, or things that you&#8217;ve watched on television, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just curious, because I genuinely feel like the whole thing is a bit of a storm, and you&#8217;re being blown around, and some things seem to be landing, and other things seem to, we have a go and it fits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are telling me that the metrics that you are getting are saying that what you&#8217;ve built is working, which is great. But I can imagine that six months from now, something else will have come along, spun the whole thing around, and you are going to have to get, well, not back to the drawing board, but you might well have to reimagine the things that you&#8217;ve done. So where do you even begin to look for inspiration in this space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think there is always a fear that someone will come and top you, in such a way that will make you irrelevant. I&#8217;m not worried about that personally, but I get it, and I definitely know that it exists. I think there&#8217;s a lot more involved in like someone just being able to come and trump you that hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We announced Kadence AI last March, and it&#8217;s honestly annoying to me that it wasn&#8217;t until January of this year that we officially launched it publicly. We had a beta version last summer. So we&#8217;ve had our cards on the table for a long time of like, this is what we&#8217;re building and this is how it&#8217;s going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that there&#8217;s other plugins and products that have done other things, I mean, Jetpack itself released an AI. And that does a lot of inline, you know, editing great for bloggers, where you want to generate content. I know that there&#8217;s other WordPress AI generated page builders, ZipWP is one. Great product in their approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there&#8217;s definitely different ways to go about it. And for us, we put our cards on the table last March, we had to get that done. And the trickiest parts were getting the AI to consistently respond, in a format that allowed us to input that into the content that we had. And then trial and error, and things like that really came into play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big piece for us, which was kind of annoying, we had to spend so much time on it, but we have a large user base. And we needed to create a credit system for our licenses, that allowed us to give everyone access to this tool, but also protect ourselves, because every time this communication happens with OpenAI, it costs us money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was an annoying, massive overhaul of a product licensing system, that had to have backward compatibility, and be implemented across our product line. And that delayed AI by several months, frustratingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, as far as like choosing where to go from here, we have a channel at work that&#8217;s like AI stuff. Essentially, someone in our org is posting in there every single day with, have you seen this tool? Have you seen this tool? I mean, I&#8217;m curious. I&#8217;m all in on, I&#8217;m watching the videos, what are they doing? I&#8217;m really interested. I want to know what people are doing, and how they&#8217;re thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;m also using ChatGPT everyday, because I want to make sure that I&#8217;m really staying engaged with it, and then allowing myself to think, how do I improve upon what we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think is a lot different than like, what if you had a blank slate? You had no customer base, and you&#8217;re trying to create a product that&#8217;s unique. That&#8217;s a little bit harder to do versus like, here we have 400,000 active installs with Kadence blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do these customers need, and how do I give them the tools? And, how does AI benefit them? And to me, AI is a tool, it is not a solution. And I think that that&#8217;s really important in my mind, in terms of thinking of, how can I use AI, and how can I bring AI into the Kadence world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting. Over the last few years, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that you, or Kadence, we could use those interchangeably perhaps, have achieved, and I&#8217;m doing air quotes, success. You know, three years ago, I suspect the install base was almost nowhere near the number that you just quoted at us. And it&#8217;s been a real rise. So congratulations for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was something that I was going to ask you about, whether or not that growth forces you to put the brakes on a little bit? In the sense that, you know, you&#8217;ve got this existing user base, you can&#8217;t possibly ship something which breaks 400,000 plus websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, you have to get their buy-in, in a way. And I know that they&#8217;re your customers, but they&#8217;re also the people that you need. And so if you do something shockingly different all of a sudden, we know how that goes. That typically doesn&#8217;t go well. So just an intuition as to whether or not you can&#8217;t be quite as nimble as you would like to be, or if there&#8217;s the breaks that you&#8217;ve got to put on. Do you have to be ultra cautious? Difficult question, and maybe one that you&#8217;re not willing to answer, but i&#8217;ll throw it out there anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I would say that the speed of development has changed, because we have improved our systems. Which, on one hand, slows us down a little bit more, in terms of some of the rapid releases I was doing early on, when it was like me and no one else, or like me and my sister and a support person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve definitely slowed down from some of that, but we&#8217;ve also done a lot less hot fixes, and bug fixes, because we&#8217;ve implemented more QA and testing. You know, obviously like we&#8217;ve helped that system a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve also done a lot of stuff, and Kadence over the years, that has improved the code quality, and the structure of the code significantly. But backward compatibility is really tricky, and there are lots of times in a developer&#8217;s life, man, this would be so much easier if we could just start from scratch. Because so much changes, and Kadence Blocks was built originally before Gutenberg was part of Core. We released it in September, and it became part of Core in December of 20 or 2019, 2018. Gosh, I can&#8217;t even remember the year that Gutenberg became part of Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;ve rewritten product multiple times, to try to keep it up to date, and it&#8217;s always a challenge. And that backward compatibility is always a challenge. And just even, I mean, when we originally wrote it, Grid CSS and Flex CSS were not fully supported as like things that you could use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like, just even the structure of our blocks were so different, because we couldn&#8217;t rely on some of this new CSS, and that challenge is real. And that desire to just, give me a clean slate from a developer. Every developer will tell you, they would love that iterative, fixing of older code is so hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s the hard work. And that has slowed us down, certainly it has slowed us down. But I&#8217;m also really proud of that work, because we&#8217;ve really fought to do as much as we possibly can to keep backward compatibility, and to continue to improve the code base, so that we&#8217;re thinking future. And so yes, you know, we&#8217;ve had a lot of success, and things have changed for me and, you know, my day-to-day in a large part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what&#8217;s causing the slowdown is not necessarily that we&#8217;ve been successful, as much as all the other things that come into play, when you talk about a product that&#8217;s been around for more than a couple years. And that&#8217;s the, we got to do a major revamp on this code base, and we&#8217;ve got to prepare all these blocks for what we&#8217;re doing in Gutenberg today versus, you know, four years ago, that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Prior to the whole advent of AI and all of that, did you have a roadmap which looked really different than what it is now? Because I don&#8217;t build software, but I can imagine that if I did build software, I&#8217;d want to be staring into the future as far as I could go. I would want that roadmap to be, you know, agile, but at least have some North Star to be heading towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering, if AI kind of upended that, it was more of a case of, oh okay, there&#8217;s this, right. Throw all that away. Did any of that happen? Did you have to sort of retool the team, or take new people on, or just, like I say, throw away the old roadmap and begin again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Roadmap for me, or generally like Kadence, is usually not too much more than six months out. Mostly because we learn a lot from our users. The users determine the roadmap more than any other factor, and we&#8217;re continuously updating what we&#8217;re going to be working on in six months, because things change and WordPress changes. So it&#8217;s not as long term as you might think. Like, I don&#8217;t know what Kadence will be developing next January. I have some ideas, certainly. Some back of the mind thoughts, but nothing that we have committed to or decided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the main shift that happened for us is ChatGPT came out, and within a month we were like, we&#8217;re not building starter templates anymore. And that was the big shift. We were kicking out starter templates, at least two a month, of these, you know, niche sites. And we just decided then to pull the plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were like, the future is going to be AI generated starter templates. We have to solve that problem. Let&#8217;s stop spending any resources that we can, on the old way of, it&#8217;s old and we just had released them, right? But like that old way of thinking. And that was, what did AI do in terms of shifting our mindset? It was like, we&#8217;ve got to put everything into getting AI starter templates out the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, because I&#8217;m part of Stellar, we didn&#8217;t have to go to the Kadence dev team, and I&#8217;m one of them, right? And say, you guys who are working on all this stuff that we were doing, we were working on some major dynamic content stuff, some advanced query block stuff, big rewrite of Kadence blocks. We didn&#8217;t have to go to that team and say, everybody stop what you&#8217;re doing, we&#8217;re doing AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were able to pull resources from our parent company, and that was the team. We formed a whole new team to say, let&#8217;s see if we can solve the AI problem. Which I was a part of, but I wasn&#8217;t the entirety of that team. And so I spent the last year, half on Kadence and half on AI. And that&#8217;s probably not accurate time, but like basically I&#8217;ve been on two teams. Then I got our Kadence team involved, as we integrated the AI stuff we had done into Kadence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how we were able to do that, is we were able to think, okay, we have a use case for how Kadence is going to use AI. But from a Stellar level, all of our products could benefit. LearnDash, for example, has already implemented AI into it. You can get a course outline done using AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we went and developed backend tools, and a server that does all the proxy communication with OpenAI, and all the caching, and all of that licensing piece. That was work that a different team, not the Kadence dev team did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it really helped in us being able to keep releasing things with Kadence theme, and Kadence blocks all of last year, while there was another team working on this whole AI piece. And then towards the end of last year, we spent that time integrating it really into, well, I mean we&#8217;ve been doing it the whole time. We had a beta version out last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, that work then bringing in more of the Kadence dev team, and support team, and all of that to kind of get it out the door. That came at the end where it&#8217;s like, when we announced, hey, we&#8217;re going to do AI, there was a lot of fear that, well, what about your roadmap? What about you guys developing this or that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that was the feedback we were getting, is everyone was very concerned, hey, AI seems like it could be a fad. And we were like, no, hold on, we&#8217;re still doing that. We were just fortunate enough to be able to have resources from outside of our brand, come in and work on a lot of the AI stuff. And so that helped a lot with the roadmap. But obviously the starter templates piece was a shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really nice that in the background you&#8217;ve got a bigger company, and the AI piece, a lot of the technologies, there&#8217;ll be a lot of commonality there. And so if you build that backend, like you say, the tooling that you need for LearnDash, and all of the different bits and pieces that make up the StellarWP Suite. And you can all share in the benefits of all of that rather than, I don&#8217;t know, five or six different companies all trying to achieve the same thing. So the economies of scale work really well there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty brave decision though, I&#8217;ve got to say, because I think, if you were to go back four or five years, everybody was, do you remember NFTs and Crypto and all that? There was that same euphoria, and it was going to be the future. And I think there&#8217;s quite a lot of people who down tools, and just moved in that direction. And fast forward to today, that now looks like it was a mistake. I think we can probably consign that to the dustbin of history. Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong about that, but it feels like that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And intuitions a couple of years ago about, let&#8217;s throw everything at AI, that could have gone the same way. It didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think it did. It really doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to go that way. It looks like it&#8217;s going to continue into, you know, for the next decade or however. Again, I could be wrong about that. But it&#8217;s a brave decision for you, the company to make. And it looks like you&#8217;re on the right side of history, so it&#8217;s a sigh of relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think the fact that NFTs, so many people were like, what is this, and how does it work, and all of that? It&#8217;s part of the reason why you could get on board with AI a lot easier, because everybody could open up ChatGPT and go, oh wow, this isn&#8217;t the annoying Verizon Wireless, or whatever, large company chat bot that I get at support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very different and improved. And I think that&#8217;s part of why it wasn&#8217;t easy to be like, this could be implemented and used, and be very useful. And I would say we did the bare minimum of, we&#8217;re doing text replacement on layouts. The future of having an AI do more creative, and I&#8217;m using air quotes when I say creative, work with you, is going to be really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think that it&#8217;s a phenomenal tool to work with you. Like, as far as you being able to guide it, influence it. I think it&#8217;s going to take a lot of the time consuming, exhausting work of making this all look exactly right out, which is going to be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am going to get into the nuts and the bolts of the actual stuff that you&#8217;ve built over at Kadence. I dropped a URL at the beginning. It&#8217;ll be in the show notes. If you go over to there, you&#8217;re going to find a video right at the top of the page. Caveat emptor. I don&#8217;t know if that will be there in the days, weeks, or months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a video. It&#8217;s a few minutes long. I think it&#8217;s you, Ben, it sounds like you. And you are running through the process of basically building a WordPress website from scratch. And I&#8217;m going to paraphrase it, and if I miss a step out here, forgive me, but I&#8217;ll just, for the sake of brevity, I&#8217;ll just paraphrase it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, you begin this wizard, and you enter some basic details. Details about your company. You describe the business, it spits back at you some possible keywords, and you select those. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you do what you often do with AI, you pick a tone, you know, this sort of feeling of how you wish the website to be. And then you go into the image selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all of that gets consumed by the AI. It has a think for, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right word. It does what it does. And then it brings back some layouts for you. And you&#8217;ve got this selection of layouts, and your intuition says, that&#8217;s the one. So you pick that. You then start adjusting colors, and it disallows, or at least it prompts you that that&#8217;s not going to be a good selection, in terms of accessibility, which is nice, thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you mess around with the fonts a little bit, and you import some pages that you wish, that you think would be appropriate. So you&#8217;re nearly there. You, at that point, launch the site, if you wish. All the pages get imported, and your site is ready to be launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you&#8217;re into the process of tweaking it, and making it your own. I think anybody using AI would advise you to do. Edit with the block editor, go in, use the AI to amend things if you wish, or just do it yourself. And then you can begin the process of saying, actually, this row is just way off message. Let&#8217;s just swap that one out, and just pick a different one. And again, the AI can step in and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that took me longer to say than it takes to do, I suspect. That is pretty incredible. And it&#8217;s leveraging all the different bits and pieces that you mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this in any way bound to the products that you release? So I know that you&#8217;ve got a theme. I know that you&#8217;ve got a block suite, and there&#8217;s a pro version of that block suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having played with it myself, I can see that you&#8217;ve definitely used the blocks that are at your disposal. But, how does that work if I don&#8217;t have access to your pro suite? Would I even be able to use this? Is this available? Is there any kind of free plan? Can I just pay for the AI bit? And what if I decide that I want to back away from it and, I don&#8217;t know, amend things? Is there any lock in, is essentially what I&#8217;m saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Certainly. There is a free tool. Kadence Blocks is free, and Kadence Theme is free, and Kadence Starter Templates is free. You can get a free account to use AI. You&#8217;ll get 250 credits, which is more than enough to build a website. You could build a couple with that many credits. And so if you&#8217;re using free, you will have slightly limited choices into which layout you can choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you get to the point where you&#8217;re shown layouts, we&#8217;re going to give you, let&#8217;s call it six. Two of those will be pro only. And that means that when we design those layouts, they&#8217;re actually using pro blocks that we have. And so if you imported them, it wouldn&#8217;t work, because you don&#8217;t have pro, so you can&#8217;t access those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one of the free layouts, which I&#8217;ve already looked at one of our, you know, our more popular one is a free one right now. You can do the whole thing for free. And you don&#8217;t have any cost to you. You can go and try it out. We have a way for you to try it out in InstaWP as well. And that&#8217;s free. So if you just want to like play around, that is on our site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as content lock, and this goes into a really interesting conversation of, how avoidable is content lock in WordPress, and in websites in general? And, how do we get away from that? Because the blocks are part of the core editor, if you delete Kadence blocks from your website, the HTML markup will still exist on your website, because it&#8217;s just block markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the rendering of those blocks won&#8217;t function, because they depend on Kadence blocks to be rendered. And that&#8217;s how all custom blocks work in WordPress, is that if you have a custom block, you need that code to essentially handle the rendering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is work, and we&#8217;re scoping some of this out. There is work, and Matt Mullenweg talked about this State of the Word, to do more data liberation. Where you could say, I&#8217;m using Kadence Blocks, but I want to convert this to Core Blocks, or I&#8217;m using Spectra Blocks, and I want this to convert to Kadence Blocks, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue with that, is that there is almost never a one for one with any of these tools. Elementor to Kadence, Elementor to Core. All of these kinds of ideas of being able to migrate out of one system into another is fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is the text and images. Not fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is a one for one of this to that, because Kadence Blocks wouldn&#8217;t exist if we didn&#8217;t massively expound upon what&#8217;s in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one would use it, if it didn&#8217;t take it a whole lot further. And so to convert these blocks to core blocks, you will lose functionality. You will lose the ability to have the accordions, and the tabs, and the sliders, and the certain types of image overlays and animations, and all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is there content lock? Yes. There&#8217;s content lock with core blocks as well. If you want to take core blocks to the classic editor, that doesn&#8217;t really work. So it all depends on what your definition of content lock is, and whether or not you feel like this is the system that&#8217;s going to be around for a while, and supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think, when you look at Kadence, we&#8217;re backed by a much larger company. There&#8217;s a lot of longevity in using Kadence Blocks, in terms of being able to render out those blocks for you, and the focus on backward compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I think data liberation is really interesting? Absolutely. I think where I think about data liberation is, how do we get, and this is what AI, I think, could be really good at. How do we get out of the mindset of, can I move from HTML to WordPress, or Wix to WordPress, or Core Blocks to Kadence Blocks, or Elementor to Beaver Builder, or whatever it is that you want to move?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we stop thinking about tools and go, you have a website, it&#8217;s HTML and JavaScript? Can we train an AI to convert that to some kind of standardised information? Where it basically says, here&#8217;s the JSON markup of this site. This is the type of content it is. Everyone builds importers for that type of thing, so you could say, I want this site in Kadence Blocks. And we use AI to convert that site into some kind of standardised markup that says, here&#8217;s all the content, the type of content, the context for how that content is. And then Kadence Blocks is an importer for that, or WordPress Core has an importer for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wouldn&#8217;t still be a one for one, because, again, there&#8217;s just no way you&#8217;re going to get a one for one, unless you convert straight to HTML. You could move it, but you wouldn&#8217;t actually be able to use it down the road. But what could be really interesting is, if you could then import that markup into whatever tool of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it might not be a one for one in design, but in terms of actually usable, and now those blocks will render, and are editable, and you can tweak the styling. And you&#8217;re that much closer. That to me is really, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the exploration for us is, can we create a system that exports? You know, where we think about grabbing the front end content, getting that into some kind of standardised system, importing that, and then exporting that in and out of that standardised system. I think that there&#8217;s a lot of really interesting stuff, in terms of just being able to process that and say, could this be a thing that we work toward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would take a lot of resources and energy, but would solve all of the weird platform specific stuff. Today what you need is a Wix to WordPress thing. Okay, like I totally get that. But I think down the road as AI gets a lot better at scraping sites, and understanding context, and being able to create, say, hey, this is an area that has media and text, that are related to each other. And we could conceive of a way of like, here&#8217;s all of the way that AI&#8217;s going to convert that content into a standardised format. And that could be really interesting for data liberation of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. The data liberation thing, really is about CMS to CMS at the moment, isn&#8217;t it? You know, it&#8217;s Shopify to WooCommerce and it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, Joomla to WordPress, or whatever it may be. But that more granular piece of, could I come from, let&#8217;s say Joomla, through WordPress, and the tools that I&#8217;m using inside of WordPress, that&#8217;s Kadence. So, can we go that extra step? Not just import it into Core Blocks, but can we then go a little bit further, because I&#8217;ve invested in Kadence, I know what I&#8217;m doing over there. Let&#8217;s give that a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, that&#8217;s really fascinating. And obviously, in everybody&#8217;s interest, if there&#8217;s some standardised way of doing that, and everybody could jump on board, so even your commercial rivals. You could access it, then the import isn&#8217;t the problem, it&#8217;s the quality of the product that is the reason why people would wish to import it. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting idea, and not one that I thought of, the data liberation thing. Yeah, we&#8217;ll see how that goes in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the AI, the way that I deployed it was into a vanilla site, to test out what you&#8217;d got. Also I noticed, I could be wrong about this, but on the video that you posted on the website, it felt like that was a vanilla site. How does the AI work if, because most people are not starting from scratch, are they? A lot of the audience listening to this, will wish to try things out on sites that they&#8217;ve already got, and push the boundaries of pages that they&#8217;ve already got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know that the blocks themselves, they can be adapted. You&#8217;ve got a bit in the, you know, the bar that appears when you interact with Gutenberg. There&#8217;s something in there which you can interact with the AI and prompt it, and what have you. But does the whole wizard that we described earlier, is there any utility in that, if you&#8217;ve already got a site? Or, is it just for beginning blank slate stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> So that Wizard, you don&#8217;t need to generate a website, although you can, and you can import that into an existing site, if you want to. That&#8217;s totally fine. But Gutenberg, we have what&#8217;s called a design library. And if you have Kadence Blocks installed, you&#8217;ll see the design library tab in the backend, like in a page editing thing at the top bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you open that up, we can generate contextual stuff, using that same information from the wizard. So if you are building a page, for example, and you&#8217;re like, I need a call to action section, that&#8217;s a context that we&#8217;ve created. You can go in and say, I want all of your sections with call to action context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the AI generated text that is for your website, about call to action. And then you can pick from the layouts. And there&#8217;s hundreds, we have over 600 different patterns in that design library. And all of those can be empowered by AI, and many of them can be used multiple times. So you might see a pattern and say, well, that&#8217;s a great pattern, that I like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can put about context into it, or I can put value proposition context into it, or call to action context into it. So you can choose the context, and then you can choose the pattern type, and then you can drop that pattern into your website. So if you have an existing website and you&#8217;re like, I even have an existing page, and I just want a section, AI can help you there. Or if you&#8217;re building a new page, and you want to piece together patterns, there&#8217;s a lot of different ways that you can use that tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you can go back through and kind of retrofit, and just swap things out. And presumably, rows and patterns kind of used interchangeably there. You can just save those, put them somewhere else for later keeping. But the idea is that you can put these different contexts in, so that you can modify the things that you&#8217;ve got. Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the stack that&#8217;s in the background? I mean, I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s OpenAI, because everybody seems to be using OpenAI. Are you keeping an open mind about OpenAI? Now there&#8217;s a phrase I should coin. Because it does seem like hot on the heels of OpenAI, you know, they really were first to market with this interactive chat like capability. Which is very beguiling, but it does seem like hot on the heels are Anthropic and Google, with all of their offerings. Are you wedded to OpenAI, well, first of all, is it OpenAI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:32] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It is open AI, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And second of all, are you wedded to that, or do you keep exploring the different models? Because it does feel, in certain contexts, that OpenAI might be feeling the pressure, let&#8217;s say. I&#8217;ve tried a few different ones out, and in a variety of different contexts, OpenAI excels. In a few, very niche contexts, there are some rivals, which absolutely, you know, they just seem to do a much better job. So anyway, I&#8217;ll just hand that one over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I think we are very much open-minded, in terms of what we do. Part of us building this whole proxy server to handle, and this whole prompt database, and the way that we communicate with OpenAI. The whole time we were thinking, this structure, all that we&#8217;re doing, if we need to switch to some other system. Because OpenAI changes their prices, or they discontinue doing what we&#8217;re using the for, or for whatever reason, we need to make sure it&#8217;s movable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have experimented with Google&#8217;s, and right now we&#8217;re using OpenAI. But in a year from now, we might not be. And I think that was a key part for us of, like we need to make sure that we have the ability to shift and move, if we&#8217;re seeing a new company come up that is significantly better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you never know. Maybe there&#8217;s somebody who&#8217;s developing something which is really adjacent to the web design industry, and an AI which is specifically for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what you&#8217;ve built, this conduit between the website and the AI. You&#8217;ve built this middleware, which sits in between. And that middleware could just be repurposed at a moment&#8217;s notice, to talk to the, I don&#8217;t know, the Gemini or Anthropic API. And so, really, you wouldn&#8217;t have much disruption to service. Ah, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:08] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> We&#8217;ve got that server in two different places, so we can experiment too. So we can experiment by just locally pinging saying, hey, use the backup server, and then, let&#8217;s experiment with that. So we have a lot of ability to do things, to test things, without disrupting our user base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that there was some sort of credit system, whereby you acquire credits, which then you spend, in order to do the transactions with the AI. How does that work? Is that like a monthly thing that you add on top? Is that a subscription service on top, or do you get a certain package when you purchase it? Just run us through how that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you mentioned that 250 credits was available on the free version. You also mentioned that that would probably get you through the process of building a couple of websites. So yeah, just talk us through the typical spend on doing things, and how the credit system works, and how do you top things up if you&#8217;re an agency, and a blowing through your credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, so we aren&#8217;t charging anything extra for the credits. They come with whatever you have. So if you&#8217;ve purchased from us, you get credits automatically into your account. And if you have an existing purchase, and if you go and purchase today, our pro products have a certain amount of credit. So Kadence Blocks Pro alone is 1200. If you go up to our essential bundle, which is Kadence Blocks Pro and Theme Pro and Starter Templates Pro, that is going to give you 4,000 credits, and then up from that is 8,000 credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We largely created the credits as a deterrent to prevent abuse, not as a system to sell you something more. And our goal is that you don&#8217;t need a separate subscription. And we want to make it so easy to use, or you&#8217;re not really worried too much about your credit count. To that point we&#8217;re talking about single lifetime credit bundle packages, that you&#8217;ll be able to buy for that agency, that&#8217;s burning through their credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going tomake that very, very cost effective. Because, again, we didn&#8217;t ever consider that credits could ever be a revenue driver. We have no plan for it to be a revenue driver. We literally just want to protect ourself on cost. So going forward, there&#8217;ll be some way to buy credits very cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole communication and stuff with OpenAI is relatively cheap. That&#8217;s part of the reason why it&#8217;s so usable, so many people are building on it, is because being able to communicate with the AI is cheap. When you take it out to a scale of 400,000 active installs, and things like that, you start to go, oh wow, this could get expensive pretty quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s where, you know, we need to limit some of that. But in general, the idea is that we give you more than enough credits. And if you are an agency, or you&#8217;re burning through a lot of credits, we&#8217;re going to make it very cheap for you to buy more. Current plan right now is a $20 package that&#8217;s going to have like 4,000 extra credits. So we&#8217;re going to make it really simple for you to just say like, oh, top me up, I need more credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just, before we wind it up, let&#8217;s close the lid on Kadence itself. And let&#8217;s just talk about your intuitions, Ben, about AI in general. Now, I&#8217;m not trying to force you to say anything here or to, you know, imply that you&#8217;ve got a certain opinion. But I&#8217;m curious as to what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s two phrases that I&#8217;m just going to raise, and one is that, you know, a rising tide carries all boats. In other words, we throw AI into the mix, and everybody&#8217;s experience of life, and website building, and all of that, just becomes better. And then there&#8217;s another phrase which is, just a race to the bottom, which is entirely the opposite, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering if you have any intuitions about that. Because, certainly amongst the people that I&#8217;ve met, who are jobing website developers, you know, they&#8217;re using tools, much like you&#8217;ve got, and rivals, to build websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is this sort of impending sense of fear amongst some of them, that the very tools which seem so beguiling at the moment, and seem so brilliant because they save a bit of time here, you know, save a minute there, and an hour there and what have you. That all is great, except that there&#8217;s this fear that maybe these tools are going to hollow out the very industry that we&#8217;re serving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the point where, well, in a few years time, you&#8217;ll just go to some webpage and tell it, I want a website to market my cat food, off you go. And, you know, three minutes later you&#8217;re done, and it&#8217;s all finished. So I wonder if you&#8217;ve been thinking about that, if you&#8217;ve got any guardrails in place, or intuitions there. I know that&#8217;s a fairly ephemeral question, it&#8217;s hard to get your hands on. But just a few minutes on your thoughts around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:15] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Sure. I think, if you are a freelancer who&#8217;s building brochure websites, and not offering anything else, other than, here&#8217;s your website, that would be a concern. I think that&#8217;s a valid concern of like, will these customers keep coming to me, for this very simple brochure website, if that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m offering?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that&#8217;s been going away for a while, and that freelancers, if you&#8217;re paying attention, you&#8217;re probably already looking at, how can I help people have an effective website, not just a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there was a time where everyone was like, I just need a website. There&#8217;s just so many local businesses that were like, I just need a website. I think we&#8217;re coming to the end of that time, and most businesses are not just saying, I need a brochure website. They&#8217;re saying, I need a website that helps me do business, even these local companies. That is able to capture on SEO, that&#8217;s able to adequately supply a convincing marketing message for someone to choose them over their competition. That represents them well online, and that allows them to be effective, and continue to serve their local communities, or broader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to me, I think if you&#8217;re a freelancer, you should be really thinking about and learning about marketing. And really thinking and learning about SEO. Because what you want to be able to offer is, yeah, this might look like a brochure website, but let me show you how it&#8217;s actually effective. Let me show you how we positioned your marketing messaging to make it effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are running the ability to do social media ads, and everything else. Like, there&#8217;s just so much more that most businesses need, most anyone who&#8217;s going to be online. I feel like, if all you&#8217;re offering is a brochure site, and done and move on, that is at risk. Because I do think that AI can create a very basic brochure site, that someone will be able to say, that&#8217;s good enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s what the majority of, especially WordPress freelancers, are really trying to pitch someone on. And I think that you just need to make sure that you are continuing to grow yourself. To say, I understand the web, the intricacies of marketing, and SEO. And I can help you, not just to make a good looking website that has your content, but make it so it&#8217;s actually something that people will be able to find, and that&#8217;s going to actually grow your business, or improve your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t think AI is going to be able to solve that. I think tools will help you solve for that. But I don&#8217;t think AI, on its own, or anything automated like that, is just going to be able to solve for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think the only thing that I know that AI will do in the future, is be an agent of change. Whatever that change is, it&#8217;s more or less a question of just putting my finger in the air and guessing, I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s fascinating to get your perspective on it, because a lot of the people that I talk to are those freelancers, they&#8217;re the people building websites. And interesting to get a different perspective. A company that&#8217;s building the tools to enable those freelancers to do the work, and all of the concerns, and thought that you are putting into building out those tools. Really fascinating conversation, I enjoyed that tremendously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before we call it a day, Ben, I&#8217;m wondering if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just sharing some of the places, or place, where people could get in touch with you, if they wish to. I will drop the URL, like I said, of the Kadence website. So if there&#8217;s anything aside from that, just let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:36] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> I&#8217;m not super active on social media, but best place would be our Kadence Facebook group. That is the one place on social media I will come in and out of. I&#8217;m not a huge social media person, but that&#8217;s one that I, that community is super fun, and I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will find a lot of very engaged people in there. So you can go in there and ping me in there. And that&#8217;s probably your best, outside of, obviously you can come to the Kadence website, and just click on our support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Great. Thank you so much, Ben. It was really a pleasure chatting to you today, all about Kadence, but also about AI. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/\">Kadence WP</a>, a company that specialises in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites. The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021 Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand, where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there’s a suite of popular plugins, including LearnDash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI-generated content and images. Ben’s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started, right through to today where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow; AI is still new, and it’s possible that what’s all the rage today might be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai/\">Next level site creation with AI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zipwp.com/\">ZipWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.learndash.com/\">LearnDash</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stellarwp.com/\">StellarWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://instawp.com/\">InstaWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/webcreatorcommunity/\">Kadence Facebook Group</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Akismet: Comment Spam: How to Protect Your Site from Spammers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283729\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"https://akismet.com/blog/comment-spam/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20903:\"<p>Everyone has encountered spam comments at one point or another, but they&#8217;re more than just an eyesore. They actually scare away real visitors, can mess with your search engine rankings, and can even pose serious cybersecurity risks. It&#8217;s a big deal, whether you&#8217;re running a small blog or a major&nbsp;business.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, there&#8217;s something you can do about it, and you don’t have to go it alone. Today, we&#8217;ll talk about what comment spam is and why it&#8217;s so important to tackle it&nbsp;head&#8209;on.</p>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll also discuss why<a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\"> Akismet</a> is your website&#8217;s best protection against spam comments. It quietly filters out all that junk (without interrupting users with annoying quizzes or buttons to click), so your site stays clean and professional — a place where real conversations can happen&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283729\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam clutters up your website&#8217;s comment sections with unwanted messages. Spammers aren’t there to join the conversation but to push their own agenda, which is often sketchy at best. Because there are strong motivations for spammers’ efforts, those with programming knowledge constantly spend time developing new ways to bypass filters and spread spam automatically through sophisticated&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>Websites and online spaces are constantly evolving, and so are the methods to combat nuisances like comment spam. Google, for instance, rolled out a significant update in<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/10/october-2023-spam-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> October 2023</a> to tackle various types of spam, including cloaking, hacking, auto&#8209;generated, and scraped content across multiple languages​​​​. This shows just how serious the issue has become globally and the efforts being made to keep online spaces&nbsp;spam&#8209;free.</p>\n\n<p>You, however, will still need to take care in preventing comment spam on your own website or blog posts. But more on that in a&nbsp;moment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the motivations behind comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam is driven by several motivations, each with its own unique impact on websites and users. Understanding these motivations can help in developing more effective strategies to counter this prevalent&nbsp;issue.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. SEO link&nbsp;building</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing spammers are often after is improving their website&#8217;s ranking on search engines. They sneak links into blog comments or other pages with a comments section, hoping it&#8217;ll boost their site&#8217;s visibility. This trick is known as SEO poisoning because it can actually hurt your own rankings as a result. And it&#8217;s still a booming business, even with many efforts in place to counteract&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Malware&nbsp;distribution</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some of these comment spammers are out to spread malware. They use those sneaky SEO tactics to get their harmful content boosted in the search results or even post links directly to the malware in the comments themselves. When your visitors click on these links, they might end up with stolen data or&nbsp;worse.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Advertising and&nbsp;promotion</h3>\n\n<p>Lastly, some spammers are just trying to push their products or services. It&#8217;s like those people who hand out flyers on the street, except they&#8217;re leaving their flyers in your comments. They use all sorts of tactics to try to get through on thousands of sites a day (or more), and because they cast such a wide net, even a tiny success rate is worth it for&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these motivations creates different challenges for site administrators and blog owners. From an SEO standpoint, comment spam can really hurt your site&#8217;s ranking. The spammy people you let hang around can rub off and give you a bad reputation. If search engines find out you&#8217;re unintentionally hosting bad links, they might penalize you. It might not sound fair, but it&#8217;s a fact all the&nbsp;same.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The adverse effects of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam can significantly impact a website in various detrimental&nbsp;ways:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Site&nbsp;reputation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Imagine walking into a party and finding trash everywhere. That&#8217;s what a website swamped with spam comments feels like. It screams neglect and poor management. Visitors will likely think twice before engaging, and genuine community members? They might just leave.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>And if those spam comments have links to shady sites, it makes it seem as though you&#8217;ve invited trouble right to your doorstep. Spam comments post a real hit to your site&#8217;s good&nbsp;name.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. SEO&nbsp;consequences</h3>\n\n\n<p>When it comes to SEO, comment spam, as we&#8217;ve already mentioned, is a real problem. Google’s got a sharp eye for sites that house spammy content. If your site is littered with this stuff, Google might think it&#8217;s not up to par, which can mean a nosedive in rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Imagine, just when you thought you were getting the hang of SEO, comment spam can pull the rug right from under you. It’s tough because a dip in search rankings means fewer visitors and, ultimately, a hit to potential&nbsp;conversions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Potential for site&nbsp;blocklisting</h3>\n\n<p>In the worst&#8209;case scenario, too much comment spam can get your site on the search engines&#8217; naughty list, i.e. blocklisted. This happens when your site is seen by search engines as a place with potentially harmful content or that at least links to dangerous websites. Recovering from a blocklisting is no joke, either. It&#8217;s a long and difficult process, so avoiding this is obviously&nbsp;preferable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common characteristics of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam typically exhibits several common characteristics that can help in identifying and filtering it&nbsp;out:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Links to external&nbsp;websites</h3>\n\n<p>First off, links in blog comments that lead to other sites are classic red flags. These aren&#8217;t just any links, though. They&#8217;re usually totally unrelated to your post and are all about getting more eyeballs on spammers&#8217; sites or boosting their SEO. Often these links pose major threats, leading to places you wouldn&#8217;t want your visitors to end&nbsp;up.</p>\n\n<p>With cybersecurity investments booming to $76 billion in 2023, according to<a href=\"https://hginsights.com/market-reports/market-report-socs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> HG Insights</a>, it&#8217;s clear everyone&#8217;s taking these threats seriously, and not just the big fish but small businesses,&nbsp;too​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Generic or flattering&nbsp;language</h3>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the flattery game. Spammers love to post comments using vague, super&#8209;positive comments like &#8220;Great post!&#8221; but they&#8217;re pretty empty and don&#8217;t add much value to your site. They&#8217;re trying to butter you up so you&#8217;ll let their comment slide through. And while not always spam, comments like these definitely raise red&nbsp;flags.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1074\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.png\" alt=\"example of a flattering spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283731\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Irrelevant&nbsp;content</h3>\n\n\n<p>Spam comments are completely off-topic. They&#8217;ll slap any old thing in the comment section, as long as they can sneak in a backlink or a plug for something. With phishing websites on the rise,&nbsp;it&#8217;s clear these irrelevant comments are part of a bigger online game.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1216\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-1.png\" alt=\"example of an off-topic spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283732\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Poorly written&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Spammers often use comments with grammatical errors either to sneak past filters searching for common spam words, to appear more human, or simply because they’re trying to write in a non&#8209;native language. So comments with numerous grammatical errors should be viewed with&nbsp;suspicion.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-2.png\" alt=\"example of a spam comment with lots of hashtags\" class=\"wp-image-283733\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Lots of pingbacks and&nbsp;trackbacks</h3>\n\n<p>These are automated or manual notifications sent when one website links to another. While they can enhance interaction between websites, they can also be used for spamming. Distinguishing between genuine and spam trackbacks or pingbacks involves assessing their relevance and the quality of the linking&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1440\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-3.png\" alt=\"example of a pingback on a blog post\" class=\"wp-image-283734\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. A sudden influx of&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>A ton of comments coming in at once, especially from new or unverified users, can be a sign of spam. This can be a coordinated effort to flood your site with spam&nbsp;comments.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Suspicious usernames or email&nbsp;addresses</h3>\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the weird usernames and email addresses. These are often pretty obvious with random numbers or bizarre word salad&#8209;style names. It&#8217;s all about creating fake identities to spread spam far and&nbsp;wide.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying these characteristics can help you in effectively managing and reducing the amount of comment spam on your website. And using tools like Akismet can help in automating the process of spam detection and&nbsp;removal.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why common anti&#8209;spam methods fall short (and what to do&nbsp;instead)</h2>\n\n<p>Common anti&#8209;spam methods, though widely used, have limitations that can make them less&nbsp;effective:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. CAPTCHA and its&nbsp;limitations</h3>\n\n\n<p>While you’re probably used to seeing CAPTCHAs or reCAPTCHAs (those tests that make you do things like decipher a string or random letters or check all the pictures with stoplights) in your everyday life, they can be a real headache for users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"828\" height=\"982\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-4.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA, asking users to select squares with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-283736\" />\n\n\n<p>Ever found yourself squinting at your screen, trying to figure out if that&#8217;s a letter or a smudge? You&#8217;re not alone. In fact, only about 66% of people get through these tests on their first try, according to the<a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/captchas-in-checkout\"> Baymard&nbsp;Institute</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the issue of accessibility. People with visual impairments can find themselves at a disadvantage with visual CAPTCHAs, and the audio alternatives have similar downfalls. Plus, those advanced bots you’re trying to block? They&#8217;re getting better at sneaking past these tests, making CAPTCHAs less effective by the&nbsp;day​​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Question&#8209;based&nbsp;challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Asking users a question to prove they&#8217;re human seems like a smart move. But it&#8217;s got its pitfalls, too. For one, bots can be programmed to answer common questions. And if your questions are too obscure or complex, you might end up turning away real humans who just wanted to interact with your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Limiting commenting to registered&nbsp;users</h3>\n\n<p>Making people sign up before they can comment is a decent barrier against spam, but it presents its own set of issues. Not everyone wants to go through the hassle of creating an account, especially if they&#8217;re just passing by. So, you might be keeping out the spam, but you&#8217;re also likely missing out on some valuable contributions from casual&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Manual review and approval of all&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Having a real person review each comment is great for quality control. But let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s a time&#8209;consuming task. If your site&#8217;s buzzing with activity, staying on top of all those comments can be a daunting, if not impossible,&nbsp;task.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these cases, using a tool like Akismet is a preferable option to keep comment spam under control. Now, let&#8217;s talk about&nbsp;why.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 tool to stop comment spam&nbsp;completely</h2>\n\n<p>Because of its popularity, you’ve probably heard of Akismet in the past — especially if you&#8217;re running a WordPress site. It&#8217;s kind of a big deal in the world of online spam&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n<p>Created by Automattic, the people behind WordPress.com, Akismet has been at the forefront of spam solutions since 2005. It&#8217;s proven itself to be a reliable ally for website owners who are tired of dealing with comment spam, but don’t want to interrupt users with annoying, unreliable&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n\n<p>What you may not know is that Akismet provides solutions for more than just WordPress sites. Thanks to its flexible API connection, it can work with many other platforms like Drupal, phpBB3, and Joomla. Abiding by the open source philosophy, Akismet likes to say that it’s built <em>by</em> developers, <em>for</em> developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Akismet&nbsp;works</h3>\n\n\n<p>So, how does Akismet keep those spam comments at bay? It&#8217;s pretty smart. When someone (or some<em>thing</em>) leaves a comment on your site, fills out a form, or submits any other form of text, Akismet’s advanced AI program can analyze it for authenticity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It’s constantly evolving and learning to maintain its incredible 99.99% accuracy&nbsp;rate.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your configuration, it can set comments aside for you to review later or automatically delete suspicious ones. Based on your feedback, it can adapt to your site for even improved performance (if that’s even&nbsp;possible).</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is all automated — for both you and your site’s visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The benefits of using Akismet to block comment&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet stands out as the best way to block comment spam&nbsp;because:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It offers real&#8209;time monitoring and adaptability</strong>. Akismet&#8217;s cloud&#8209;based system constantly learns from the billions of data points it processes from its use on over 100 million sites, allowing it to adapt to new spam techniques and protect websites against the most advanced spam&nbsp;attacks​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It has a database of known spam patterns</strong>. It also uses a massive database and sophisticated algorithms to detect and block spam, which is continuously updated to recognize new spamming&nbsp;methods​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It boasts 99.99% spam detection accuracy</strong>. One of Akismet&#8217;s standout features is its high accuracy rate in spam detection, significantly reducing the likelihood of spam slipping through the&nbsp;cracks​​.</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>You can set it and forget it</strong>. Once configured, Akismet runs autonomously, saving you considerable time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual spam moderation​​.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>It’s compatible with multiple platforms</strong>. Although primarily known for its integration with WordPress, Akismet can be utilized across various platforms, making it a versatile tool for blocking comment spam, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/forum-spam/\">forum spam</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam-on-wordpress/\">contact form spam</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-seo-spam-how-to-protect-your-wordpress-site/\">SEO spam</a>, and various other forms of unwanted&nbsp;content​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It doesn’t affect the user experience</strong>. Unlike some anti&#8209;spam tools that can be intrusive or cumbersome for users (like CAPTCHAs), Akismet operates in the background without adding friction to the user experience. This is essential for high engagement and conversion&nbsp;rates​​.</li></ol>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to start blocking comment spam today with&nbsp;Akismet</h2>\n\n<p>Blocking comment spam with Akismet can significantly enhance your website&#8217;s user experience and security. Below is a straightforward step&#8209;by&#8209;step guide to get you&nbsp;started.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin</h3>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using WordPress, there&#8217;s a good chance Akismet is already pre&#8209;installed. However, if it&#8217;s&nbsp;not:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins → Add&nbsp;New</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Search for &#8220;Akismet&#8221; in the WordPress plugin&nbsp;directory.</li>\n\n<li>Click <strong>Install Now </strong>next to the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If Akismet isn&#8217;t pre-installed or if you&#8217;re not using WordPress, visit the </em><a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/getting-started/\"><em>getting started guide</em></a><em> for more information.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button within your WordPress dashboard to activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-5.png\" alt=\"installing Akismet in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-283737\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Obtain and input your API&nbsp;key</h3>\n\n<p>To connect your site to Akismet’s&nbsp;servers:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Visit the Akismet&nbsp;website.</li>\n\n<li>Sign up for an account to obtain an API&nbsp;key.</li>\n\n\n<li>Select the plan that fits your needs (free for personal blogs; paid subscriptions are available for businesses and commercial sites). Enterprise users can <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise-pricing/\">create their own plan or discuss it with an expert</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li>Follow the instructions to generate your API&nbsp;key.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.jpeg\" alt=\"pricing plans for Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-283738\" />\n\n\n<p>After obtaining your API&nbsp;key:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go back to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Akismet →&nbsp;Settings</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Enter your API key in the designated field and&nbsp;connect.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-6.png\" alt=\"adding an API key to Akismet settings\" class=\"wp-image-283739\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Configure Akismet&nbsp;settings</h3>\n\n<p>Once activated, review the default settings for Akismet by going to <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti&#8209;Spam </strong>then finding the <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;section.</p>\n\n<p>Determine how you&#8217;d like to handle comments flagged as spam as well as the <strong>Strictness</strong> of the spam&nbsp;filter.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Monitor and adjust as&nbsp;needed</h3>\n\n<p>With Akismet now operational, you&#8217;ll want to make monitoring the spam filtering process a part of your regular website maintenance schedule. Check in on Akismet&#8217;s settings, pop into the comments marked as spam, and make adjustments to the settings if needed, based on the nature of spam comments your site&nbsp;receives.</p>\n\n<p>By following these steps, Akismet will begin to automatically monitor and filter your website’s comments and form submissions. This automation saves time and ensures a cleaner, more professional online environment for your&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Say goodbye to comment spam with&nbsp;Akismet</h2>\n\n\n<p>All-around, Akismet provides an easy-to-use solution to a massive website-related problem. It works automatically in the background with near-perfect accuracy, and is scalable and customizable for your unique program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Get started with Akismet</a>.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"Do The Woo Community: WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79061\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:450:\"<p>WooCommerce developer Uros and WordPress engineer Sabrina discuss website performance optimization, advocating for awareness, regular testing, and practical tools.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\">WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 10:41:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:233:\"HeroPress: Words to WordPress: Charting My Path Through Technology and Community! – লেখালেখি থেকে শুরু করে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার পথচলা \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=6519\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"https://heropress.com/essays/words-to-wordpress-charting-my-path-through-technology-and-community/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=words-to-wordpress-charting-my-path-through-technology-and-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18834:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020624-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Starting with WordPress might have been a coincidence, but staying with it was a choice.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#bangla\">এই নিবন্ধটি বাংলায় পাওয়া যায়</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress started unexpectedly. I will demonstrate my voyage towards WordPress as a freelancer to a full-time job holder and a contributor in the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-entered-into-the-world-of-wordpress\">How I Entered into the World of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2015, I began writing content as a freelancer, not knowing that WordPress would become such a big part of my life. At first, WordPress was just a tool for me to publish my writings. But soon, it turned into much more than that. It became the center of my career. When I graduated from Gono University with a Computer Science and Engineering degree, I didn&#8217;t imagine WordPress would be where I&#8217;d find my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-everyday-i-m-growing-with-wordpress\">Everyday I’m Growing with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After freelancing, I joined weDevs, a company known for creating WordPress plugins. This was a significant change for me. At weDevs, I wasn&#8217;t just writing; I was part of a team that made tools to help people build better websites. I learned a lot about WordPress and how it works from the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I moved to BuddyBoss, where I became a technical writer. This job was different because I had to explain how things work in a way that everyone could understand. It was challenging but also very rewarding. I enjoyed making complex ideas simple and helping others learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-volunteering-and-being-part-of-the-community\">Volunteering and Being Part of the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best parts of my journey has been volunteering at WordCamps and WordPress Meetups. Going beyond my work responsibilities, I made it a point to engage actively within the community. Till now, I have volunteered at several notable events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordCamp Kent 2020 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Northeast Ohio 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp India 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Asia 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Sylhet 2023</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These events have been enriching for me. They&#8217;ve allowed me to meet people as excited about WordPress as I am. It was great to see how strong and welcoming the WordPress community is, sharing knowledge and experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, currently, I am an Organizer of the WordPress Dhaka Community. All these years of working for WordPress paid me really well and recognized me as a community member to serve the Dhaka WordPress enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-i-ve-learned-through-the-journey\">What I&#8217;ve Learned Through the Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I see how much I&#8217;ve grown because of WordPress. It started as just a platform for my writing, but it became a way to connect with others, learn new skills, and share my knowledge. My career has taken me to places I never expected, and I&#8217;m grateful for all the opportunities WordPress has given me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that being open to new experiences and willing to learn can lead you to exciting places. WordPress has been a part of not only my career but also my personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress is far from over. There&#8217;s always something new to learn and more ways to contribute to the community. I&#8217;m excited to see where this path will take me next. Whether it&#8217;s writing, volunteering, or working on new projects, I&#8217;m ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-footnote\">Footnote</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with WordPress might have been a coincidence, but staying with it was a choice I made because of the joy and achievement it brings. My story is simple: it&#8217;s about finding your passion in unexpected places and growing with it. I hope it can inspire others to explore their interests and see where they lead.<br />When it comes to my hobbies, there&#8217;s a long list. I love traveling, reading, watching movies (but not web series), and listening to music. I have two furry babies, Judy and Deany (Shih-Tzu), and plan to adopt a cat soon. These personal joys add another layer of happiness and fulfillment to my life, making my journey with WordPress even more rewarding.

এ প্রতিষ্ঠানে আমি এমন একটি টিমের সাথে যুক্ত ছিলাম, যারা গ্রাহকদের জন্য আরও উন্নত ওয়েবসাইট তৈরি করার প্রয়োজনীয় সরঞ্জাম তৈরি করতো।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি সেখান থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস সম্পর্কে অনেক কিছুই শিখি এবং জানতে পারি কিভাবে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর ব্যাকএন্ড থেকে কাজ হয়। এরবাইরে&nbsp;

সঠিক ভাবে BuddyBoss প্লাগিন ব্যবহার করতে পারবে। এই কাজ আমার কাছে যেমন চ্যালেঞ্জিং ছিল তেমনি ছিল আমার ক্যারিয়ারের জন্য মাইলফলক। টেকনিক্যাল জটিল সব ব্যাপারগুলো সহজভাবে ব্যবহারকারীদের কাছে তুলে ধরতে এবং তাদেরকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শেখানোর কাজটি এখানে থেকে আমি উপভোগ করছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ভলেন্টিয়ার এবং কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে আমার যাত্রা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস পথচলার অন্যতম অংশ হচ্ছে ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এবং WordPress Meetups-এ ভলেন্টয়ারী কাজ করা। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক কাজের বাইরে যেয়ে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটিতে সক্রিয়ভাবে জড়িত থাকার চেষ্টা করি। এখন পর্যন্ত, আমি বেশ কয়েকটি উল্লেখযোগ্য ইভেন্টে ভলেন্টিয়ার হয়েছি:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>১।ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প কেন্ট ২০২০ (অনলাইন)<br />২। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প উত্তরপূর্ব ওহাইও ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৩। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প ইন্ডিয়া ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৪। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এশিয়া ২০২৩ <br />৫। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প সিলেট ২০২৩</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এই ইভেন্টগুলো আমার জন্য খুবই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল। এ ইভেন্টগুলতে আমি আমার মতোই অন্য ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমিদের সাথে দেখা করার এবং যোগাযোগ করার সুযোগ পাই, যারা আমার মতই ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসকে ভালবাসে। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটি কতটা শক্তিশালী এবং কিভাবে তারা নতুনদের স্বাগত জানাচ্ছে, জ্ঞান আর অভিজ্ঞতা ভাগাভাগি করে নিচ্ছে এ ব্যাপারগুলো দেখতে পারা আমার কাছে দুর্দান্ত এক অভিজ্ঞতা ছিল।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>বর্তমানে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস ঢাকা কমিউনিটির একজন অর্গানাইজার। ঢাকা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটির পক্ষ থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের ব্যাপারে উৎসাহীদের সহযোগিতা করতে আমাকে একটি কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে স্বীকৃতি দেয় যা আমার কাছে সত্যিকার ভাবেই অনেক সন্মানের।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">এ যাত্রাপথে আমি যা শিখেছি</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>অতীতের দিকে ফিরে তাকালে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের কারণে কোন পর্যায়ে এসেছি সেটা দেখতে পাই। যা আমার লেখা প্রকাশের একটি প্ল্যাটফর্ম হিসাবে শুরু হয়েছিল, সেটাই এখন অন্যদের সাথে সংযোগ করার মাধ্যম হিসেবে, নতুন দক্ষতা অর্জনের এবং আমার অভিজ্ঞতা অন্যদের সাথে ভাগ করার একটি মাধ্যম হয়ে উঠেছে। আমার কর্মজীবন আমাকে এমন এক জায়গায় নিয়ে এসেছে যা আমি কখনো কল্পনা করিনি। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসই আমাকে এই সব সুযোগ দিয়েছে এর জন্যে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর কাছে কৃতজ্ঞ।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি এখান থেকে শিখেছি নতুন কোনো অভিজ্ঞতা ও নতুন কিছু শেখার জন্য আগ্রহী থাকলে নিজেকে অসাধারণ সব জায়গায় নিয়ে যাওয়া সম্ভব। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শুধুমাত্র আমার কর্মজীবনই নয়, আমার ব্যক্তিগত জ্ঞান সমৃদ্ধিরও একটি অংশ।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আমার ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রা কখনোই শেষ হবার নয়। এখানে সবসময় নতুন কিছু শেখার আছে এবং কমিউনিটিতে অবদান রাখার আরও নানান উপায় আছে। এই পথচলা আমাকে পরবর্তী কোথায় নিয়ে যাবে তা দেখতে আমি খুবই উৎসাহী। আমি নতুন চ্যালেঞ্জ এবং সুযোগের জন্য সবসময় প্রস্তুত সেটা লেখা-লেখি, ভলেন্টিয়ারী, বা নতুন প্রজেক্টে কাজ করা যে ভাবেই হোক না কেন।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আজ এ পর্যন্তই</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে যাত্রা শুরু করা আমার জন্য হয়তো একটি কাকতালীয় ঘটনা ছিল, কিন্তু এখানে কাজ করে আমি যে আনন্দ পেয়েছি এবং যা অর্জন করেছি তা বলে শেষ করার মত নয়৷ আমি আশা করি, আমার এই পথচলার গল্প ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমীদের অনুপ্রাণিত করবে এবং আগামীতে নেতৃত্ব দিতে সাহায্য করবে৷</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার শখের একটি দীর্ঘ তালিকা আছে৷ আমি ঘুরে বেড়াতে, বই পড়তে, সিনেমা দেখতে (কিন্তু ওয়েব সিরিজ নয়), এবং গান শুনতে পছন্দ করি। আমার দুটি পোষা কুকুর আছে, জুডি এবং ড্যানি, এবং শীঘ্রই একটি বিড়াল দত্তক নেওয়ার ইচ্ছেও আছে৷ এই নির্মল আনন্দগুলো আমার জীবনে সুখ এবং পরিপূর্ণতার আরেকটি স্তর যোগ করে, যা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রাকে আরও বেশি ফলপ্রসূ করে তোলে প্রতিদিন। আপনি যদি আমার সাথে যোগাযোগ করতে চান তাহলে বিস্তারিত জানতে আমার ওয়েবসাইট&nbsp;

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, it is February. For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.
